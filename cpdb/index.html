<p>The Capital Projects Database (CPDB), a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Capital Planning division, captures key data points on potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects sponsored or managed by a capital agency in and around NYC.</p>
<p>Information reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) three times per year is the foundation that CPDB is then built off of; therefore, only the capital projects that appear in the Capital Commitment Plan are reflected in CPDB.  Other open data resources are also leveraged to map the capital projects.</p>
<p>CPDB supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York Cityâ€™s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning.</p>

<h2 id="ii-limitations-and-disclaimers">II. Limitations and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>CPDB is only as good as the source data it extracts and aggregates; therefore, CPDB includes data on current and planned NYC capital projects reported in OMB's Capital Commitment Plan and it does not capture all historic, current, or future capital projects.  </p>
<p><strong>CPDB is not a project or financial management system</strong>.  Data on project timeline may be incorrect and budgetary information may be incomplete since all monies committed to or spent on a project may not be captured.  CPDB does capture planned commitments allocated to projects that may never come to fruition; these instances are most frequent for projects funded by discretionary funding sources, such as council member funding.</p>
<p>Currently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of current and planned City capital projects, but the <strong>spatial data are not 100% reliable, accurate, or exhaustive</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>map of capital projects is incomplete</strong> because many capital projects could not be spatially referenced due to vague descriptions not including the name of a site.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some projects are mapped incorrectly</strong>.  Some projects are geocoded to agency's headquarters rather than the site where the capital investment and construction is taking place.  Other projects are mapped to the wrong site as a result of two places having the same name or similar names. Unfortunately, these records cannot be systematically verified and corrected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time.</p>
<p><strong>For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing or sponsor agency.</strong></p>
<p>As a result of these limitations and inconsistencies, <strong>CPDB should not be used for quantitative analyses</strong>.  CPDB should be used for planning coordination and information purposes only.
If CPDB is used for any spatial analyses it is crucial to recognize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at <a href="mailto:CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov">CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov</a>.</p>
<h2 id="iii-methodology">III. Methodology</h2>
<p><strong>Building CPDB</strong></p>
<h3 id="loading-data-dependencies">Loading data dependencies</h3>
<p>Numerous datasets are required to build CPDB, so these are loaded into the database first.  Most of these datasets are public.</p>
<h3 id="get-raw-data-and-choose-primary-data-source">Get raw data and choose primary data source</h3>
<p>CPDB can be built using the public data obtained from the Capital Commitments Plans published by OMB or the data from FMS supplied by FISA.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Commitments Plan PDFs</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download PDFs</li>
<li>Scrape data from PDFs</li>
<li>Load raw data table into database as omb_capitalcommitments</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>FMS data from FISA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download data from FISA FTP</li>
<li>Transform .asc file to .csv file</li>
<li>Upload .csv to DCP FTP</li>
<li>Load raw data table into database as fisa_capitalcommitments</li>
</ol>
<p>Specify the primary data source in the <em>cpdb.config.json</em> file.  The default primary data source is <em>omb_capitalcommitments</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Create the CPDB base tables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>cpdb_projects</strong></p>
<p>A project is defined as a unique FMSID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>cpdb_budgets</strong></p>
<p>A budget is a unique budget line.  Many budgets can fund one one project and many projects are funded by one budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>cpdb_commitments</strong></p>
<p>A commitment is an individual planned commitment.  Multiple planned commitments fund one project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These base tables report the data at the three different levels.</p>
<h3 id="developing-the-cpdb_dcpattributes-table">Developing the <em>cpdb_dcpattributes</em> table</h3>
<p>This table contains all of DCP's value adds to the raw data, such as classifying and mapping the projects.</p>
<p><strong>Categorize the projects</strong></p>
<p>By matching words in the project's short description to a list of ~600 keywords group the projects into 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IT, Vehicles, and Equipment</strong></p>
<p>Any project that can be included in this group is added to this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lump Sum</strong></p>
<p>For allocations of funds that will be drawn from to create new projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixed Asset</strong></p>
<p>For projects where the work will take place at one or many fixed locations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects that can not be classified into any of these three categories based on keywords in the short description are left as <strong>Unknown</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping the projects</strong></p>
<p>Projects were mapped using three methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Agency data</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Design and Construction (DDC), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) all publish spatial data of their capital projects, and each geometry includes the associated FMDID(s).  Therefore, we aggregate the geometries from these data sources to the FMSID and then add these geometries by joining on FMDID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Algorithms</strong></p>
<p>Often the location of the project is specified in the project's short description.  Using a series of algorithms we are able to extract the specified location, such as a park id or park name, and join on geometries from an existing public data source, such as park properties or the facilities database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>For many projects the location(s) of the project is/are specified in the project's short description, but a geometry cannot be associated with the project by joining to an existing dataset on FMS ID or mapping the project algorithmically.  Therefore, many projects were mapped via manual research, which involved a DCP team member reading the short description of the project and creating a geometry for that projects representing where that project is taking place.</p>
<p>New geometries can be added to CPDB by adding a BIN with the assocaited FMSID to the <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/capitalprojects_db/blob/master/capitalprojects_build/attributes/id_bin_map.csv">id_bin_map.csv</a>, which works best for building based projects, or by creating a geometry using <a href="https://nycplanning.github.io/simple-geom-editor/">DCP's Simple Geom Editor</a> and adding the outputted .json file to the <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/capitalprojects_db/tree/master/capitalprojects_build/attributes/geometries">geometries folder</a>.</p>
<p>We focus mapping projects that have be categorized as a "Fixed Asset."</p>
<p><strong>Agency verified</strong></p>
<p>During the Summer of 2017 we with the support of OMB worked with each capital agency to verify the locations of the projects that we mapped and correct them if they were incorrect, and to map where possible projects that we were not able to map and that we've classified as a "Fixed Asset" or "Unknown" type of project.</p>
<p>The agency projected new or corrected location information by providing the address, bin, bbl, or other id or the location(s) where that project was taking place</p>
<ol>
<li>Format table for database consumption</li>
<li>Load .csv onto DCP FTP</li>
<li>Load into database</li>
<li>Create geometries based on BIN, BBL, or bridge id</li>
<li>Create geometries by geocoding addresses</li>
<li>Aggregate geometries to the FMS ID.</li>
<li>Append new or corrected geometries from the <em>dcp_cpdb_agencyverified</em> onto the <em>cpdb_dcpattributes</em> table and overwrite any existing geometries.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Removing geometries</strong></p>
<p>We make mistakes.  As we've QA/QCed and worked with CPDB if we noticed any project mapped incorrectly we've added the FMSID to the <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/capitalprojects_db/blob/master/capitalprojects_build/cpdb_geomsremove.csv">cpdb_geomsremove.csv</a>.  At the end of the build process geometries for these projects are removed as long as the geometry did not come directly from an agency.</p>
<p>If an agency indicated that a project cannot be mapped now or ever the geometries for these projects were removed.</p>
<p><strong>Standardizing geometries</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>All buildings are represented as points</li>
<li>Lines are turned into polygons</li>
<li>All geometries are made into multi-geometries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Create master flat file</strong></p>
<p>Run a final .sql script to create the master flat file that aggregates information, such as spending data, to the project level.</p>
<h3 id="updating-the-production-data-tables-for-the-capital-projects-explorer">Updating the production data tables for the Capital Projects Explorer</h3>
<ol>
<li>Output 4 .csv files and 2 .shp files from the database.</li>
<li>Upload the files to the CartoProd server.<ul>
<li>cpdb_projects.csv</li>
<li>cpdb_budgets.csv</li>
<li>cpdb_commitments.csv</li>
<li>cpdb_projects_combined.csv</li>
<li>cpdb_dcpattributes_pts.shp</li>
<li>cpdb_dcpattributes_poly.shp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run one final SQL script in Carto to create array fields and create new table named cpdb_projects_combined from output.</li>
<li>Point Explorer to reference latest datasets</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="iv-data-dictionary">IV. Data Dictionary</h2>
<p>The source data used to build CPDB determines what attributes are reported by the final product.  Using FMS data from FISA provides the greatest level of detail and accuracy, and outputs the most attributes.  Attributes marked with a <strong>' * '</strong> are exclusive to FISA source data. </p>
<p>The tables that compose CPDB are all related by the FMS ID.</p>
