#Capital Planning Database
The Capital Planning Database (CPDB), a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Capital Planning division, captures key data points on past, present, and planned capital projects in and around NYC sponsored or managed by a capital agency. By capturing the location and timeline for capital projects CPDB enables citywide analyses of investments over time and space, and provides a central data source for agencies to evaluate synergies among projects.

Currently, CPDB aggregates and synthesizes spatial data from five NYC capital agencies, recording more than 10,000 past, present, and planned NYC capital projects occurring throughout NYC.  As new data become available these data will be processes and integrated into CPDB.

## Overview
| General information |
| :------------: | ------------- |
| Description | The Capital Planning Database (CPDB) captures key data points on past, present, and planned capital projects in and around New York City (NYC) sponsored or managed by a capital agency |
| Data format | GeoJSON, shapefile, csv |
| Projection | WGS84 |
| Date last updated | 08/15/16 |


## Database structure
Three tables compose CPDB: Projects, Sites, and Budget.

A project is defined as an investment or series of investments made by a capital agency.  A project can span multiple sites and can be funded by multiple funding sources, but all other attributes, such as cost and timeline, remain constant.  The projects data is composed of data derived from the source datasets.

A site is a single location where a project or portion of a project is taking place.  Many sites can makeup one project, but each project occurring at a single site is reflected as an individual record in the sites table.

The budget is each line item from the City's Financial Management System (FMS).  FMS tracks the City's budget and spend.  If an FMS ID is provided for a project it can be linked an FMS line item.

##Limitations and Disclaimers
CPDB is only as good as the source data it aggregates.  Currently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource, but it does not capture every past, present, or planned capital project within NYC.  For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing agency.

If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at [CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov](mailto:CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov)
