# City Planning Facilities Database

## I. Overview

The City Planning Facilities Database aggregates more than 35,000 records from 43 different [public data sources](http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#vi-source-data) provided by City, State, and Federal agencies. While each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:

* Health and Human Services
* Education, Child Welfare, and Youth
* Parks, Gardens, and Historical Sites
* Libraries and Cultural Programs
* Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice
* Core Infrastructure and Transportation
* Administration of Government

Within each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the [Contents and Classification Hierarchy](http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#ii-contents-and-classification-hierarchy) section.

This database and its [interactive map](http://capitalplanning.nyc.gov/facilities) build upon and replace City Planningâ€™s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database. Improvements include more facility types, improved data quality, and a restructured database for easier use. We have also automated our data-update processes for the majority of sources. Please read more about the [limitations](http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#iii-limitations-and-disclaimers) of this data product below.

Special thanks to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis.

We are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at [Capital@planning.nyc.gov](mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov) with any suggestions.

## II. Contents and Classification Hierarchy

In order of increasing granularity, each record that is included in the database is classified by DCP into a **Domain > Facility Group > Facility Subgroup > Facility Type**. There are around 450 facility types. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description. The tables below describe each of the Subgroups in each of the seven Domains; however, the Facility Types within them are not listed.

## III. Limitations and Disclaimers

The City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB) is only as good as the source data it aggregates, and the Department of City Planning cannot verify the accuracy of all records. Please read more about specific data and analysis limitations before using this data.

**Analysis Limitations.** As a result of the data limitations and inconsistencies listed below users should be careful in their use of this database so as to avoid developing suspect analyses. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source datasetâ€™s latest update in the [Source Data](http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#vi-source-data) section.

**Missing Records.** Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource available for facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded from the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Also, many records could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data are processed, please review the [Methodology](http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#iv-methodology).
 
**Duplicates.** Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility because several source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets.

**Administrative Addresses.** There are known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather than the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. For more detailed information on a specific facility reach out to the respective oversight agency.

**Public Accessibility of Sites.** DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.

If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at [Capital@planning.nyc.gov](mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov).



## IV. Methodology

### Data Processing

Since the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data will be transformed over several stages to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the [NYC Planning GitHub page](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/db-facilities).

**Assembly.**
First, the desired columns in the source data are mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.

**Geoprocessing.**
Many source datasets only provide addresses without coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the [GeoClient API](https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api) using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Source records with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the roadbed, and not inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid if a BIN could not be assigned and used for the geometry instead. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.

**Duplicate Record Removal.** Several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records that fall within the same BIN or BBL and have the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.


<!-- The processing steps and assumptions used for each record are indicated in the Processing Flag (processingflag) field in the database. Each of the flags is defined in the table below.

| Data Processing Flag | Definition |
| :-- | :-- |
| address2geom_borough | Geometry, BBL, BIN, and Zip Code were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and borough provided by an agency. |
| address2geom_zipcode | Geometry, BBL, BIN, and borough were generated by NYC GeoClient using the address and zip code provided by the agency. |
| bbljoin | Geometry and address were provided by an agency but without a BBL. BBL was obtained by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO |
| bbljoin2address | Geometry was provided by an agency but without an address or BBL. BBL and address were obtained by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO |
| bbljoin_closest | Geometry was provided by an agency without a BBL. No spatial overlap was found with a BBL in MapPLUTO, even though the facility is of a type which should be located on a BBL lot. The closest BBL was assigned to the record. |
| bbljoin2address_closest | Geometry was provided by an agency without an address or BBL. No spatial overlap was found with a BBL in MapPLUTO, even though the facility is of a type which should be located on a BBL lot. The closest BBL was assigned to the record. |

## V. Data Dictionary

The following table lists and defines each of the fields presented in the Facilities Database as they are organized in the database from left to right.

| Field Alias | Field Name | Description |
| :------------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Unique Identifier | uid | Universal Unique Identifier.  When a row is added to the table the uid is automatically generated, enabling database replication. |
| Geom | geom | How the feature is spatially represented. |
| Old ID | idold | Non-unique identifier generated and maintained by the former database admin that relates to old version of SFPSD. |
| Agency ID | idagency | Non-unique identifier generated and maintained by the data admin of the parent agency that relates to the record in the source dataset. |
| Facility Name | facname | The name of the facility in proper case. |
| Address Number | addressnum | The address number of where the facility is located, validated by GeoClient. If the address that is available for the site is not complete with an address number (only the street name), this field is left blank. |
| Street Name | streetname | The name of the street where the facility is located, validated by GeoClient. If the address that is available for the site is not complete with an address number (only the street name), this field is left blank. |
| Address | address | The concatenated value of AddressNumber and StreetName of where the facility is located. If there is not a valid, complete address available, any location description that was provided is included in this field. |
| City | city | The USPS preferred the name of the addressed city where the facility is located. Generated by GeoClient and spatial joins. This field contains some blanks for facilities that do not overlap with the shoreline Zip Code boundaries. |
| Borough | boro | The full name of the borough the facility is within. |
| Borough Code | borocode | The number value representing the borough the facility is within. |
| ZIP Code | zipcode | The ZIP Code the facility is within. This field contains some blanks for facilities that do not overlap with the shoreline Zip Code boundaries. |
| Latitude | latitude | The latitude of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient. |
| Longitude | longitude | The longitude of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient. |
| X Coordinate | xcoord | The X coordinate of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient. |
| Y Coordinate | ycoord | The Y coordinate of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient. |
| BIN | bin | The [BIN](http://a030-goat.nyc.gov/goat/glossary.aspx#bin) values for the buildings the facility is located in. This field contains blanks because 1) some lots do not have buildings on them, and 2) some lots have multiple buildings and a single BIN could not be reliably assigned given the information provided in the source data. There may also be cases where a facility is actually comprised by multiple BINs but only one is recorded in FacDB because the others were not provided in the source data and could not be reliably assumed based on the single address provided for the facility. |
| BBL | bbl | The [BBL](http://a030-goat.nyc.gov/goat/glossary.aspx#bbl) values for the tax lots the facility is located on. This field contains blanks, because some facility categories, like pedestrian plazas, are not located on tax lots. There may also be cases where a facility is actually comprised by multiple BBLs but only one is recorded in FacDB because the others were not provided in the source data and could not be reliably assumed based on the single address provided for the facility. |
| Community Board | commboard | The Community District the facility is within. This field contains blanks because the Community District boundaries do not capture facilities beyond the shoreline. |
| Council District | council | The City Council District the facility is within |
| Census Tract | censtract | The U.S. Census Tract the facility is within |
| NTA | nta | The Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) the facility is within. This field contains blanks because the NTA boundaries do not capture facilities beyond the shoreline. |
| Facility Domain | facdomain | The value representing the facility domain, the broadest category. |
| Facility Group | facgroup | The value representing the group type, the second broadest category. |
| Facility Sub-Group | facsubgrp | The value representing the subgroup type. |
| Facility Type | factype | The value representing the facility type, the most granular category of facilities. |

| Capacity Type | captype | The value representing the unit type of capacity, such as beds, visitors, seats, etc. |
| Utilization | util | How many of capacity type/unit are being utilized at the facility. |
| Utilization Rate | utilrate | The ratio of the of utilization over the total facility capacity. |
| Area | area | The total area of the site measured in the Area Type unit. For many types of facilities, no area information was available. The area-related fields are blank when no information was provided in the source data. |
| Area Type | areatype | The unit of measurement for Area. |
