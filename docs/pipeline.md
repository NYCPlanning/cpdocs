# Residential Pipeline
The Residential Pipeline is a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Capital Planning division. It aims to help City agencies understand the distribution of residential development across time and space, in order to support both capital and operational planning. 

The underlying database integrates administrative City data on both new construction and building alterations. Currently, it integrates permits and Certificates of Occupancy (CofOs) from the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB), as well as data on affordable housing projects from Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). Going forward, it will encompass new data from these sources, data gathered from DCPâ€™s land use approval process (ULURP), and other sources if / as identified.

In the coming months, we will pair this product with a Non-Residential Pipeline that provides similar information regarding other types of development (commercial, manufacturing, recreational, etc.). Together, these products will form a comprehensive Development Pipeline. The remainder of this document will focus on the Residential Pipeline, but we welcome users' thoughts on if/how this methodology can be adapted for Non-Residential puroposes.    

We are constantly seeking feedback on how to improve and make this data resource most valuable.  Please reach out to the NYC Planning Capital Planning team at [Capital@planning.nyc.gov](mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov) with any suggestions or comments.
