# Facilities Database
The Facilities Database (FacDB), a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Capital Planning Division, captures the location, type, and capacity of public and private facilities ranging across six domains:

* Health Care and Human Services
* Youth, Education, and Child Welfare
* Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice
* Core Infrastructure and Transportation
* Parks, Cultural, and Other Community Facilities
* Administration of Government

This data resource provides agencies and communities with easy access to data and neighborhood context needed for site planning, assessing service delivery, preparing neighborhood plans, or informing capital investment decisions. The facilities and program sites are generally operated, funded, licensed, or certified by a City, State, or Federal government agency. 

Currently, FacDB aggregates and synthesizes data sourced from _ agencies, recording more than 31,000 facilities throughout NYC. A full listing of the facility types is provided in the Data Dictionary.

Historically, these records were updated only once per year. Beginning with this latest September _, 2016 release, the database is being produced using a revamped approach that relies heavily on automating the collection and transformation of data that agencies already publish. The process has been automated to pull from all available source datasets twice per month, so that the database will be as up-to-date as possible. 85% of the data sources are open datasets that agencies publish independently.

## Database structure
Two tables compose FacDB:

* Facilities with Geolocations - Primary Table
* Facilities That Could Not Be Geocoded - 
* Relational tables....

Since most datasets did not include an identifying facility ID, the NEED TO FINISH

Additional information for certain facility types can be joined in using relational tables and the Global Unique Identifier.

## Methodology

### Data Processing

Since all facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on Github (LINK).

**Assembly.**
First, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description 

**Geoprocessing.**
Many records are provided with only addresses, no coordinates, and visa versa. Records without coordinates are geocoded using the address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the coordinates and the BIN and BBL. Records with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and then run the BBL through GeoClient to get the address and other location related details like Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN.

**Final Cleanup.**
A few final scipts are run at the end to recapitalize acronoyms, calculate and fill in remaining x, y coordinates, and exclude any facility records outside the NYC boundary.


### Source Data

The following datasets were used to populate the Facilities Database.

### Department of Design and Construction (DDC)
DDC is the City's primary capital construction manager; therefore, DDC centrally manages much of the City’s capital projects portfolio.
