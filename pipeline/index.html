<p>The Residential Pipeline is a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Capital Planning division. It aims to help City agencies understand the distribution of residential development across time and space, in order to support both capital and operational planning. </p>
<p>The underlying database integrates administrative City data on both new construction and building alterations. Currently, it integrates permits and Certificates of Occupancy (CofOs) from the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB), as well as data on affordable housing projects from Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). Going forward, it will encompass new data from these sources, data gathered from DCP’s land use approval process (ULURP), and other sources if / as identified.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will pair this product with a Non-Residential Pipeline that provides similar information regarding other types of development (commercial, manufacturing, recreational, etc.). Together, these products will form a comprehensive Development Pipeline. The remainder of this document will focus on the Residential Pipeline, but we welcome users' thoughts on if/how this methodology can be adapted for Non-Residential purposes.    </p>
<p>We are constantly seeking feedback on how to improve and make this data resource most valuable.  Please reach out to the NYC Planning Capital Planning team at <a href="mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov">Capital@planning.nyc.gov</a> with any suggestions or comments.</p>

<td>Description</td>
<td>The Residential Pipeline integrates administrative City data on both new construction and building alterations. Under current methodology, DOB permits are the core dataset around which database is built. Permits are matched with DOB CofOs to determine completion; then, HPD data is then appended (where available) to provide information on the number on City-subsidized, affordable units in each development.</td>

<h3 id="limitations-disclaimers">Limitations &amp; disclaimers</h3>
<p>There are a number of known limitations to this dataset and improvements will be made on a continual basis, based on internal reviews and user feedback. </p>
<h4 id="geocoding-and-geospatial-integration">Geocoding and geospatial integration</h4>
<ul>
<li>~95% of DOB permits successfully geocoded using Borough-Block-Lot (BBL), DOB Building Identification number (BIN) and address </li>
<li>~90% of HPD projects successfully matched with permit record, using BBL. We assume that all HPD projects should have a corresponding DOB permit and failure to find a matching BBL in each dataset indicates errors in BBLs. HPD projects without a match in DOB data are thus excluded, as we can assume the permit is included but with the correct BBL.  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="expired-permits">Expired permits</h4>
<p>DOB data includes permit filings from 2010 through present. Some “outstanding” permits (those without Certificate of Occupancy) may have since expired, however, this is not available in current datasets. Going forward, we will seek to identify and exclude expired permits.</p>
<h4 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h4>
<p>The user-ready version of this dataset excludes likely duplicates and projects with no change in units, as determined by DCP.
<em> Duplicates: in some cases, it appeared that multiple permits were generated for a single development. For example, this could occur if an initial permit had administrative errors that were corrected by issuing a new permit. Since the data does not include permit expiration date (per above), we cannot determine if/which permits are outdated. To avoid double-counting, we identified  likely duplicates using the Building Identification Number (BIN) listed in the DOB permit. We have only retained the most recent instance of a given BIN in the database.
</em> Projects without change: In some cases, alteration permits are required for administrative reasons rather than actual construction. To prevent such permits from skewing analyses, we have excluded any alteration permits that are missing data about existing and/or projected number of units. </p>
<h4 id="other-data-sources">Other data sources</h4>
<p>For some analyses, it may be appropriate to include likely developments that have not yet received permits (e.g., projects where DCP has approved a land use change, or permits that have been filed but not approved). Due to the uncertainty of such developments, they are not included in this version. </p>
<h2 id="methodology-key-terms-and-data-dictionary">Methodology, key terms and data dictionary</h2>
<p>This section provides a visual overview of how input datasets are processed and integrated. A glossary of "key terms" accompanies this overview, and is intended to aid casual users in understanding the most important concepts.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a "Full data dictionary" which defines every field in the database. This is intended for users seeking a more detailed understanding of the data, particularly those who intend to use it for analyses. </p>
