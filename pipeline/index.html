<p>The Development Pipeline aims to help New York City planners understand changes resulting from building activity, across both time and space. It is currently comprised of data from the Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), and includes the most comprehensive picture of new residential development taking place across the five boroughs. DCP will be working over the months to come to add other, non-residential developments to this pipeline, and to integrate other data sources.</p>
<p>This product include recently-completed residential development activity (last 5+ years), as well data on developments that are at various stages in the permitting process.  Completed or “partially complete” projects have received Certificates of Occupancy for at least a portion of their permitted units. Permitted sites are those that have received building permits; although not all of these sites will necessarily be built and completed over the next few years, this category is the City’s best predictor of where new housing will be built in the near future. Sites identified in the “permit pending” category demonstrate where developers have completed applications for new building (NB) permits or major alterations (A1) permits that will change the number of residential units in a building; these sites may give a general direction of where developers are seeking to deliver new housing units, but since they have not yet received permits, the certainty of their development cannot be assured.  In addition to the information derived from permits and Certificates of Occupancy, some records are appended with HPD data regarding the number of affordable housing units.</p>
<p>Special thanks goes to the NYC Department of Buildings and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development who make their data available for this map. </p>

<td align="left">The Residential Pipeline integrates administrative City data on both new construction and building alterations. Under current methodology, DOB permits are the core dataset around which database is built. Permits are matched with DOB CofOs to determine completion; then, HPD data is then appended (where available) to provide information on the number on City-subsidized, affordable units in each development.</td>

<h3 id="limitations-disclaimers">Limitations &amp; disclaimers</h3>
<p>There are a number of known limitations to this dataset and improvements will be made on a continual basis, based on internal reviews and user feedback. </p>
<h4 id="geocoding-and-geospatial-integration">Geocoding and geospatial integration</h4>
<p>~ 95% DOB permits were successfully geocoding using BBL or address. Geocoding ‘rejects’ were researched by DCP but not every site could be verified. </p>
<p>~75% of HPD records were matched with their corresponding DOB permit using the BBL listed in each dataset. We assume that all HPD projects should have a corresponding DOB permit, and manual research confirms that most un-matched HPD projects list an outdated BBL. Going forward, DCP will work with HPD to improve and integrate this data.   </p>
<h4 id="expired-permits">Expired permits</h4>
<p>These data include permit filings from 2010 through Q3 2016. Some “outstanding” permits (those without Certificate of Occupancy) may have since expired, however, this information not available in current datasets. Going forward, we will seek to identify and exclude expired permits.</p>
<h4 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h4>
<p>The database excludes likely duplicates and projects with no change in units, as determined by DCP.</p>
<p>Duplicates: in some cases, it appeared that multiple permits were generated for a single development. For example, this could occur if an initial permit had administrative errors that were corrected by issuing a new permit. Since the data does not include permit expiration date (per above), we cannot determine if/which permits are outdated. To avoid double-counting, we identified  likely duplicates using the Building Identification Number (BIN) listed in the DOB permit. We have only retained the most recent instance of a given BIN in the database.</p>
<p>No change in units: In some cases, alteration permits are required for administrative reasons rather than actual construction. To prevent such permits from skewing analyses, we have excluded any alteration permits that are missing data about existing and/or projected number of units. </p>
<h4 id="other-data-sources">Other data sources</h4>
<p>For some analyses, it may be appropriate to include likely developments that have not yet received permits (e.g., projects where DCP has approved a land use change, or permits that have been filed but not approved). Due to the uncertainty of such developments, they are not included in this version of the Residential Pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-key-terms-and-data-dictionary">Methodology, key terms and data dictionary</h2>
<p>This section provides a visual overview of how input datasets are processed and integrated. A glossary of "key terms" accompanies this overview, and is intended to aid casual users in understanding the most important concepts.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a "Full data dictionary" which defines every field in the database. This is intended for users seeking a more detailed understanding of the data, particularly those who intend to use it for analyses. </p>
