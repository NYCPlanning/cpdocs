These facilities generally impact the quality of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and they range across six domains:\n\n\n\n\nHealth Care and Human Services\n\n\nYouth, Education, and Child Welfare\n\n\nPublic Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice\n\n\nCore Infrastructure and Transportation\n\n\nParks, Cultural, and Other Community Facilities\n\n\nAdministration of Government\n\n\n\n\nThis database and interactive map build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces, and capture the location, type, and capacity of public and private facilities in order to inform holistic neighborhood planning, strategic site selection and service delivery planning, opportunities for interagency and public-private partnerships, community outreach activities, and many other functions across City agencies.\nOne goal of this database is to provide a consolidated, authoritative dataset that can serve as a one-stop-shop to planners. More broadly, the intent is to provide the foundation for a more robust data-integration initiative, ensuring interoperability between disparate agencies\u2019 datasets.\n\n\nCity Planning has grouped these facilities according to the following six domains, each with a set of groups, subgroups, and facility types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names are pulled directly from source datasets, wherever possible.\n\n\nCurrently, FacDB aggregates and synthesizes data sourced from 42 agencies, recording more than 45,000 facilities throughout NYC. More facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the \nOverview\n.\n\n\nWe are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n with any suggestions.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\n\"Facilities Database \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Facilities Database (FacDB) captures the locations and descriptions of public and private facilities ranging from the provision of social services, recreation, education, to solid waste management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap\n, \nShapefile\n, \nCSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\n11/01/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilities Classification Heirarchy\n.

Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Many records could not be geocoded. There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.\n\n\nDuplicates.\n Please be aware that this beta version of the database also includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these duplicate records and retain the most up-to-date and detailed record.\n\n\nAnalysis Limitations.\n As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\nData Processing\n\n\nSince the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the \nNYC Planning GitHub page\n.\n\n\nAssembly.\n\nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.\n\n\nGeoprocessing.\n\nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses, no coordinates, and visa versa. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the \nGeoClient API\n using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the coordinates and the BIN and BBL. Records with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN. There are also many cases where the coordinates provided by the agency fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the coordinates were left as provided, and the BBL was joined on according to which BBL edge was closest to the point coordinates. This closest BBL was used to fill in any other missing location information. Each record in the database is flagged in the with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.\n\n\nDuplicate Record Removal.\n Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BBL as a record with the same Facility Group. The contents of this subset is this examined for similarities in the Facility Name. The record with the most complete or most updated information was kept and other duplicate record is removed from the database.\n\n\nThe processing steps and assumptions used for each record are indicated in the Processing Flag (processingflag) field in the database. Each of the flags are defined in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Processing Flag\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naddress2geom_borough\n\n\nGeometry, BBL, BIN, and zipcode were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and county or borough provided by agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naddress2geom_zipcode\n\n\nGeometry, BBL, BIN, and borough were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and zip code provided by agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbbljoin\n\n\nGeometry and address were provided by agency but without a BBL.

consists of two tables. One table contains all the geocoded records with spatial data, and one with the records which could not be geocoded.\n\n\nIn the future, some supplemental information which is specific to certain facility types will also be included in the database package as relational tables. For exmaple, a table of park attributes or a table with a more granular breakdown of school enrollment by grade could be joined onto the main table using a unique ID.",

            "text": "The City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB) aggregates information about facilities and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York. These facilities generally impact the quality of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and they range across six domains:   Health Care and Human Services  Youth, Education, and Child Welfare  Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice  Core Infrastructure and Transportation  Parks, Cultural, and Other Community Facilities  Administration of Government   This database and interactive map build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces, and capture the location, type, and capacity of public and private facilities in order to inform holistic neighborhood planning, strategic site selection and service delivery planning, opportunities for interagency and public-private partnerships, community outreach activities, and many other functions across City agencies.\nOne goal of this database is to provide a consolidated, authoritative dataset that can serve as a one-stop-shop to planners. More broadly, the intent is to provide the foundation for a more robust data-integration initiative, ensuring interoperability between disparate agencies\u2019 datasets.  City Planning has grouped these facilities according to the following six domains, each with a set of groups, subgroups, and facility types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names are pulled directly from source datasets, wherever possible.  Currently, FacDB aggregates and synthesizes data sourced from 42 agencies, recording more than 45,000 facilities throughout NYC.

            "text": "FacDB is only as good as the source data it aggregates. Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Many records could not be geocoded. There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.  Duplicates.  Please be aware that this beta version of the database also includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these duplicate records and retain the most up-to-date and detailed record.  Analysis Limitations.  As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.  If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov .",

            "text": "Since the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the  NYC Planning GitHub page .  Assembly. \nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.  Geoprocessing. \nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses, no coordinates, and visa versa. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the  GeoClient API  using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the coordinates and the BIN and BBL. Records with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN. There are also many cases where the coordinates provided by the agency fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the coordinates were left as provided, and the BBL was joined on according to which BBL edge was closest to the point coordinates. This closest BBL was used to fill in any other missing location information. Each record in the database is flagged in the with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.  Duplicate Record Removal.  Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BBL as a record with the same Facility Group. The contents of this subset is this examined for similarities in the Facility Name. The record with the most complete or most updated information was kept and other duplicate record is removed from the database.  The processing steps and assumptions used for each record are indicated in the Processing Flag (processingflag) field in the database. Each of the flags are defined in the table below.     Data Processing Flag  Definition      address2geom_borough  Geometry, BBL, BIN, and zipcode were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and county or borough provided by agency.    address2geom_zipcode  Geometry, BBL, BIN, and borough were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and zip code provided by agency.    bbljoin  Geometry and address were provided by agency but without a BBL. BBL was obtained by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO    bbljoin2address  Geometry was provided by agency but without an address or BBL. BBL and address were obtained by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO    bbljoin_closest  Geometry was provided by agency without a BBL. No spatial overlap was found with a BBL in MapPLUTO, even though the facility is of a type which should be located on a BBL lot. The closest BBL was assigned to the record.    bbljoin2address_closest  Geometry was provided by agency without an address or BBL. No spatial overlap was found with a BBL in MapPLUTO, even though the facility is of a type which should be located on a BBL lot. The closest BBL was assigned to the record.",

            "text": "Capital Projects Explorer\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Explorer, a data product produced by the New York City Department of City Planning (NYC Planning) Capital Planning team, integrates dispersed spatial datasets of capital projects published by capital agencies into one database and inclusive data explorer. \n\n\nTogether these data sources report over 6,000 capital projects that span over a multitude of sites.\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Explorer\u2019s goal is to act as a starting point for planners exploring what capital projects are taking place within an area, means to identify potential conflicts and synergies among capital projects, and resource for all City agencies to learn more about capital projects by providing easy access to high level information on capital projects.\n\n\nThe primary function of the Capital Projects Explorer is to enable a user to view all of the capital projects with spatial data collected from the various data sources on one map and explore key data points associated with a capital project.  The explorer facilitates the identification of a capital project and access more detailed information.\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Explorer as a data resource and explorer can help to better inform neighborhood planning, reducing situations where projects conflict and increase opportunities for interagency coordination. \n\n\nWe are constantly seeking feedback on how to improve and make this data resource most valuable.  Please reach out to the NYC Planning Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n with any suggestions or comments.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset name\n\n\n\"Capital Projects Explorer\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Explorer captures high-level information on past, present, and planned capital projects in NYC by aggregating spatial data on capital projects published by capital agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap, GeoJSON, Shapefile, CSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\n10/28/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations and Disclaimers\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Explorer is only as good as the source data it aggregates.  Currently, the Capital Projects Explorer is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of past, present, or planned City capital construction sites, but it does claim to capture all historic, current, or future City capital construction sites.  \n\n\nDuplicates.\n  Cases of duplicate records exist within the Capital Projects Explorer because some of the source datasets have overlapping content, but different unique identifiers making it difficult to systematically identify and reconcile duplicate records.\n\n\nInconsistent data standards.\n  Capital agencies manage their capital projects data separately and have varying data standards to meet their needs.  Different data standards across source datasets can become problematic when integrating datasets, especially when some key data points are missing from records because these data are not captured in the source data.  Furthermore, source data may have common fields but the values within these fields may be very different.  Therefore, data are reconciled and assumptions are made to normalize data into one data table.  Read more about the data normalization process within the Methodology.\n\n\nWhat is a project?\n  As a result of inconsistent data standards and different project management systems, capital agencies define project differently.  For example, one capital project can span multiple sites across several boroughs based on one agency's system, while another project management system considers a bathroom renovation at one site a capital project.  The inconsistent definition of a capital project and the varying sizes, scopes, and impacts of capital projects has the potential to skew analyses generated from these data.\n\n\nCompleteness.\n  This dataset does not capture the entirety of NYC's Capital Budget.  The Capital Projects Explorer is built using records from agencies' project management systems, which do not always maintain a link to budget lines, making it impossible to account for the whole Capital Budget.\n\n\nDifferent update frequencies\n  As a result of the different project management systems the data feeding the Capital Projects Explorer are updated at various frequencies, ranging from daily to unknown.  As a result, the freshness of the data in the Capital Projects Explorer varies depending on the data source.\n\n\nAs a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies the Capital Projects Explorer is not an analysis tool.  It does not report any metrics, and the data should not be used for quantitative analyses.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov\n.  For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing agency.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\nData Processing\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Explorer aggregates records from numerous datasets designed for different purposes; therefore, the data need to undergo several stages of transformation before being integrated into the single table.  The stages are described below and all of the data processing scripts used are available on the NYC Planning GitHub page.\n\n\nAssembly.\n  First, the desired columns in the source data are mapped to the fields in the Capital Projects Explorer's data schema.  Second, the source data values are formatted to match the datatype of the corresponding field.  Next, source data values are standardized before being loaded into the Capital Projects Explorer.  Data standardization mostly occurs in the managing agency, sponsor agency, and current status fields.  Lastly, missing data points are identified and filled in if it is possible to derive the missing values from other existing data attributes.\n\n\nGeoprocessing.\n  The format of the source datasets vary.  If the source data are not in a spatial data format spatial data was created for the Capital Projects Explorer.  The process of creating spatial data varies by source dataset but generally it involves joining the source dataset to an existing spatial dataset by a common data attribute.\n\n\nDuplicate record removal.\n  Several source datasets have overlapping content.

Together these data sources report over 6,000 capital projects that span over a multitude of sites.  The Capital Projects Explorer\u2019s goal is to act as a starting point for planners exploring what capital projects are taking place within an area, means to identify potential conflicts and synergies among capital projects, and resource for all City agencies to learn more about capital projects by providing easy access to high level information on capital projects.  The primary function of the Capital Projects Explorer is to enable a user to view all of the capital projects with spatial data collected from the various data sources on one map and explore key data points associated with a capital project.  The explorer facilitates the identification of a capital project and access more detailed information.  The Capital Projects Explorer as a data resource and explorer can help to better inform neighborhood planning, reducing situations where projects conflict and increase opportunities for interagency coordination.   We are constantly seeking feedback on how to improve and make this data resource most valuable.

            "text": "The Capital Projects Explorer is only as good as the source data it aggregates.  Currently, the Capital Projects Explorer is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of past, present, or planned City capital construction sites, but it does claim to capture all historic, current, or future City capital construction sites.    Duplicates.   Cases of duplicate records exist within the Capital Projects Explorer because some of the source datasets have overlapping content, but different unique identifiers making it difficult to systematically identify and reconcile duplicate records.  Inconsistent data standards.   Capital agencies manage their capital projects data separately and have varying data standards to meet their needs.  Different data standards across source datasets can become problematic when integrating datasets, especially when some key data points are missing from records because these data are not captured in the source data.  Furthermore, source data may have common fields but the values within these fields may be very different.  Therefore, data are reconciled and assumptions are made to normalize data into one data table.  Read more about the data normalization process within the Methodology.  What is a project?   As a result of inconsistent data standards and different project management systems, capital agencies define project differently.  For example, one capital project can span multiple sites across several boroughs based on one agency's system, while another project management system considers a bathroom renovation at one site a capital project.  The inconsistent definition of a capital project and the varying sizes, scopes, and impacts of capital projects has the potential to skew analyses generated from these data.  Completeness.   This dataset does not capture the entirety of NYC's Capital Budget.  The Capital Projects Explorer is built using records from agencies' project management systems, which do not always maintain a link to budget lines, making it impossible to account for the whole Capital Budget.  Different update frequencies   As a result of the different project management systems the data feeding the Capital Projects Explorer are updated at various frequencies, ranging from daily to unknown.  As a result, the freshness of the data in the Capital Projects Explorer varies depending on the data source.  As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies the Capital Projects Explorer is not an analysis tool.  It does not report any metrics, and the data should not be used for quantitative analyses.  If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov .  For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing agency.",

The stages are described below and all of the data processing scripts used are available on the NYC Planning GitHub page.  Assembly.   First, the desired columns in the source data are mapped to the fields in the Capital Projects Explorer's data schema.  Second, the source data values are formatted to match the datatype of the corresponding field.  Next, source data values are standardized before being loaded into the Capital Projects Explorer.  Data standardization mostly occurs in the managing agency, sponsor agency, and current status fields.  Lastly, missing data points are identified and filled in if it is possible to derive the missing values from other existing data attributes.  Geoprocessing.   The format of the source datasets vary.  If the source data are not in a spatial data format spatial data was created for the Capital Projects Explorer.  The process of creating spatial data varies by source dataset but generally it involves joining the source dataset to an existing spatial dataset by a common data attribute.  Duplicate record removal.   Several source datasets have overlapping content.  Duplicate records are identified and reconciled when two or more records shared the same FMS ID.  If two or more records share the same FMS ID the record from the most authoritative data source is kept.

It is currently comprised of data from the Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), and includes the most comprehensive picture of new residential development taking place across the five boroughs. DCP will be working over the months to come to add other, non-residential developments to this pipeline, and to integrate other data sources.\n\n\nThis product include recently-completed residential development activity (last 5+ years), as well data on developments that are at various stages in the permitting process.  Completed or \u201cpartially complete\u201d projects have received Certificates of Occupancy for at least a portion of their permitted units. Permitted sites are those that have received building permits; although not all of these sites will necessarily be built and completed over the next few years, this category is the City\u2019s best predictor of where new housing will be built in the near future. Sites identified in the \u201cpermit pending\u201d category demonstrate where developers have completed applications for new building (NB) permits or major alterations (A1) permits that will change the number of residential units in a building; these sites may give a general direction of where developers are seeking to deliver new housing units, but since they have not yet received permits, the certainty of their development cannot be assured.  In addition to the information derived from permits and Certificates of Occupancy, some records are appended with HPD data regarding the number of affordable housing units.\n\n\nSpecial thanks goes to the NYC Department of Buildings and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development who make their data available for this map. \n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\"Residential Pipeline\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Residential Pipeline integrates administrative City data on both new construction and building alterations. Under current methodology, DOB permits are the core dataset around which database is built. Permits are matched with DOB CofOs to determine completion; then, HPD data is then appended (where available) to provide information on the number on City-subsidized, affordable units in each development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nWebmap, GeoJSON, Shapefile, CSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated\n\n\n10/31/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations \n disclaimers\n\n\nThere are a number of known limitations to this dataset and improvements will be made on a continual basis, based on internal reviews and user feedback. \n\n\nGeocoding and geospatial integration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95% DOB permits were successfully geocoding using BBL or address. Geocoding \u2018rejects\u2019 were researched by DCP but not every site could be verified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n~75% of HPD records were matched with their corresponding DOB permit using the BBL listed in each dataset. We assume that all HPD projects should have a corresponding DOB permit, and manual research confirms that most un-matched HPD projects list an outdated BBL. Going forward, DCP will work with HPD to improve and integrate this data.   \n\n\n\n\nExpired permits\n\n\nThese data include permit filings from 2010 through Q3 2016. Some \u201coutstanding\u201d permits (those without Certificate of Occupancy) may have since expired, however, this information not available in current datasets. Going forward, we will seek to identify and exclude expired permits.\n\n\nExclusions\n\n\nThe database excludes likely duplicates and projects with no change in units, as determined by DCP.\n\n Duplicates: in some cases, it appeared that multiple permits were generated for a single development. For example, this could occur if an initial permit had administrative errors that were corrected by issuing a new permit. Since the data does not include permit expiration date (per above), we cannot determine if/which permits are outdated. To avoid double-counting, we identified  likely duplicates using the Building Identification Number (BIN) listed in the DOB permit. We have only retained the most recent instance of a given BIN in the database.\n\n No change in units: In some cases, alteration permits are required for administrative reasons rather than actual construction. To prevent such permits from skewing analyses, we have excluded any alteration permits that are missing data about existing and/or projected number of units. \n\n\nOther data sources\n\n\nFor some analyses, it may be appropriate to include likely developments that have not yet received permits (e.g., projects where DCP has approved a land use change, or permits that have been filed but not approved). Due to the uncertainty of such developments, they are not included in this version of the Residential Pipeline.\n\n\nMethodology, key terms and data dictionary\n\n\nThis section provides a visual overview of how input datasets are processed and integrated. A glossary of \"key terms\" accompanies this overview, and is intended to aid casual users in understanding the most important concepts.\n\n\nIn addition, there is a \"Full data dictionary\" which defines every field in the database.
