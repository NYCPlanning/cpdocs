Overview\n\n\nThe Department of City Planning aggregates information about 33,000+ facilities and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed, or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York into a central database called the City Planning Facilities Database FacDB). These facilities generally help to shape quality of life in the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and this dataset is the basis for a series of planning activities. This public data resource allows all New Yorkers to understand the breadth of government resources in their neighborhoods.\n\n\nWhile each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services\n\n\nEducation, Child Welfare, and Youth\n\n\nParks, Gardens, and Historical Sites\n\n\nLibraries and Cultural Programs\n\n\nPublic Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice\n\n\nCore Infrastructure and Transportation\n\n\nAdministration of Government\n\n\n\n\nWithin each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided \nhere\n.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about these data please contact the NYC Planning Open Data team at DCPOpendata@planning.nyc.gov\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\nFacilities Database (FacDB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency Name\n\n\nDepartment of City Planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Frequency\n\n\nQuarterly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Description\n\n\nFacilities and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Keywords\n\n\nFacilities, Education, Child Welfare, Parks, Gardens, Historical Sites, Libraries, Cultural Programs, Public Safety, Emergency Services, Administration of Justice, Health Services, Human Services, Infrastructure, Transportation, Government Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Category\n\n\nCity Government\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\nThe Department of City Planning aggregates information about 33,000+ facilities and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York into a central database called the City Planning Facilities Database FacDB). These facilities generally help to shape quality of life in the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and this dataset is the basis for a series of planning activities. This public data resource allows all New Yorkers to understand the breadth of government resources in their neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach record in FacDB represents a facility site. \n\n\nFacDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource available for facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded from the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Also, many records could not be geocoded.\n\n\nThere are known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather than the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. For more detailed information on a specific facility reach out to the respective oversight agency.\n\n\nII. Common uses\n\n\nFair Share Analysis, Neighborhood studies, Facilities planning\n\n\nIII. Watch-outs\n\n\nAnalysis Limitations.\n As a result of the data limitations and inconsistencies listed below users should be careful in their use of this database so as to avoid developing suspect analyses. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source dataset\u2019s latest update in the source data dictionary.\n\n\nMissing Records.\n Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource available for facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded from the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Also, many records could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data are processed, please review the Data Sources and Compilation Process.\n\n\nDuplicates.\n Please be aware that this dataset may include cases of duplicate records for the same facility because several source datasets have content that overlap.\n\n\nAdministrative Addresses.\n There are known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather than the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. For more detailed information on a specific facility reach out to the respective oversight agency.\n\n\nPublic Accessibility of Sites.\n DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.\n\n\nIV. Data Sources and Compilation Process\n\n\nSince the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data will be transformed over several stages to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the NYC Planning GitHub page.\n\n\nData loading.\n Since the source datasets have been maintained by various agencies and updated with different frequencies, datasets are loaded into Amazon s3 as a centralized datahub preparing for the downstream data processing.  The list of data sources can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nGeoprocessing.\n When records have address information, spatial data is assigned by taking the centroid of the BIN returned by Geosupport that matches the DoITT building footprints dataset.  If a BIN is not available, the latitude and longitude returned by Geosupport is used to create the geometry for the record.  If these fields are not available from Geosupport, but the source data has spatial information (i.e. coordinates) the spatial data is created from the source data.  If the source data consisted of polygon geometries, the centroid of the polygon was used to assign the geometry for the records in the database.  There are cases where the coordinates from the source data fall in the roadbed and not inside a BBL boundary due to the geocoding technique used by the source.  Lastly, if a geometry could not be assigned from the BIN, latitude/longitude from Geosupport, or source data, the centroid of the BBL from the clipped MapPLUTO is used.  Other geographic information such as the community district is taken from Geosupport if a value is returned, otherwise administrative districts are assigned via spatial joins where the record has a geometry.\n\n\nDuplicate Record Removal.\n Several of the source datasets have content that overlaps. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records that fall within the same BIN or BBL and have the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. Where duplicate records were identified all but the primary record was removed from the database.\n\n\nV.

Other open data resources are also leveraged to map the capital projects.\n\n\nCPDB supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York City\u2019s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning.\n\n\nI. Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\n\"Capital Projects Database\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Database (CPDB) captures key data points on, including spatial data, potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap\n, Shapefile: \nPoints\n \n \nPolygons\n, GeoJSON: \nPoints\n \n \nPolygons\n, \nCSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\nMarch 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Commitment Plan version\n\n\nJanuary 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Limitations and Disclaimers\n\n\nCPDB is only as good as the source data it extracts and aggregates; therefore, CPDB includes data on current and planned NYC capital projects reported in OMB's Capital Commitment Plan and it does not capture all historic, current, or future capital projects.  \n\n\nCPDB is not a project or financial management system\n.  Data on project timeline may be incorrect and budgetary information may be incomplete since all monies committed to or spent on a project may not be captured.  CPDB does capture planned commitments allocated to projects that may never come to fruition; these instances are most frequent for projects funded by discretionary funding sources, such as council member funding.\n\n\nCurrently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of current and planned City capital projects, but the \nspatial data are not 100% reliable, accurate, or exhaustive\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmap of capital projects is incomplete\n because many capital projects could not be spatially referenced due to vague descriptions not including the name of a site.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome projects are mapped incorrectly\n.  Some projects are geocoded to agency's headquarters rather than the site where the capital investment and construction is taking place.  Other projects are mapped to the wrong site as a result of two places having the same name or similar names. Unfortunately, these records cannot be systematically verified and corrected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time.\n\n\nFor more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing or sponsor agency.\n\n\nAs a result of these limitations and inconsistencies, \nCPDB should not be used for quantitative analyses\n.  CPDB should be used for planning coordination and information purposes only.\nIf CPDB is used for any spatial analyses it is crucial to recognize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nIII. Methodology\n\n\nBuilding CPDB\n\n\nLoading data dependencies\n\n\nNumerous datasets are required to build CPDB, so these are loaded into the database first.  Most of these datasets are public.\n\n\nGet raw data and choose primary data source\n\n\nCPDB can be built using the public data obtained from the Capital Commitments Plans published by OMB or the data from FMS supplied by FISA.\n\n\nCapital Commitments Plan PDFs\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDFs\n\n\nScrape data from PDFs\n\n\nLoad raw data table into database as omb_capitalcommitments\n\n\n\n\nFMS data from FISA\n\n\n\n\nDownload data from FISA FTP\n\n\nTransform .asc file to .csv file\n\n\nUpload .csv to DCP FTP\n\n\nLoad raw data table into database as fisa_capitalcommitments\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the primary data source in the \ncpdb.config.json\n file.  The default primary data source is \nomb_capitalcommitments\n.\n\n\nCreate the CPDB base tables\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpdb_projects\n\n\nA project is defined as a unique FMSID\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpdb_budgets\n\n\nA budget is a unique budget line.  Many budgets can fund one one project and many projects are funded by one budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpdb_commitments\n\n\nA commitment is an individual planned commitment.  Multiple planned commitments fund one project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese base tables report the data at the three different levels.\n\n\nDeveloping the \ncpdb_dcpattributes\n table\n\n\nThis table contains all of DCP's value adds to the raw data, such as classifying and mapping the projects.\n\n\nCategorize the projects\n\n\nBy matching words in the project's short description to a list of ~600 keywords group the projects into 3 categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT, Vehicles, and Equipment\n\n\nAny project that can be included in this group is added to this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLump Sum\n\n\nFor allocations of funds that will be drawn from to create new projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed Asset\n\n\nFor projects where the work will take place at one or many fixed locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects that can not be classified into any of these three categories based on keywords in the short description are left as \nUnknown\n.\n\n\nMapping the projects\n\n\nProjects were mapped using three methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency data\n\n\nThe Department of Design and Construction (DDC), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) all publish spatial data of their capital projects, and each geometry includes the associated FMDID(s).  Therefore, we aggregate the geometries from these data sources to the FMSID and then add these geometries by joining on FMDID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms\n\n\nOften the location of the project is specified in the project's short description.  Using a series of algorithms we are able to extract the specified location, such as a park id or park name, and join on geometries from an existing public data source, such as park properties or the facilities database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nFor many projects the location(s) of the project is/are specified in the project's short description, but a geometry cannot be associated with the project by joining to an existing dataset on FMS ID or mapping the project algorithmically.  Therefore, many projects were mapped via manual research, which involved a DCP team member reading the short description of the project and creating a geometry for that projects representing where that project is taking place.\n\n\nNew geometries can be added to CPDB by adding a BIN with the assocaited FMSID to the \nid_bin_map.csv\n, which works best for building based projects, or by creating a geometry using \nDCP's Simple Geom Editor\n and adding the outputted .json file to the \ngeometries folder\n.\n\n\nWe focus mapping projects that have be categorized as a \"Fixed Asset.\"\n\n\nAgency verified\n\n\nDuring the Summer of 2017 we with the support of OMB worked with each capital agency to verify the locations of the projects that we mapped and correct them if they were incorrect, and to map where possible projects that we were not able to map and that we've classified as a \"Fixed Asset\" or \"Unknown\" type of project.\n\n\nThe agency projected new or corrected location information by providing the address, bin, bbl, or other id or the location(s) where that project was taking place\n\n\n\n\nFormat table for database consumption\n\n\nLoad .csv onto DCP FTP\n\n\nLoad into database\n\n\nCreate geometries based on BIN, BBL, or bridge id\n\n\nCreate geometries by geocoding addresses\n\n\nAggregate geometries to the FMS ID.\n\n\nAppend new or corrected geometries from the \ndcp_cpdb_agencyverified\n onto the \ncpdb_dcpattributes\n table and overwrite any existing geometries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving geometries\n\n\nWe make mistakes.  As we've QA/QCed and worked with CPDB if we noticed any project mapped incorrectly we've added the FMSID to the \ncpdb_geomsremove.csv\n.  At the end of the build process geometries for these projects are removed as long as the geometry did not come directly from an agency.\n\n\nIf an agency indicated that a project cannot be mapped now or ever the geometries for these projects were removed.\n\n\nStandardizing geometries\n  \n\n\n\n\nAll buildings are represented as points\n\n\nLines are turned into polygons\n\n\nAll geometries are made into multi-geometries\n\n\n\n\nCreate master flat file\n\n\nRun a final .sql script to create the master flat file that aggregates information, such as spending data, to the project level.\n\n\nUpdating the production data tables for the Capital Projects Explorer\n\n\n\n\nOutput 4 .csv files and 2 .shp files from the database.\n\n\nUpload the files to the CartoProd server.\n\n\ncpdb_projects.csv\n\n\ncpdb_budgets.csv\n\n\ncpdb_commitments.csv\n\n\ncpdb_projects_combined.csv\n\n\ncpdb_dcpattributes_pts.shp\n\n\ncpdb_dcpattributes_poly.shp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun one final SQL script in Carto to create array fields and create new table named cpdb_projects_combined from output.\n\n\nPoint Explorer to reference latest datasets\n\n\n\n\nIV.

CPDB is not a project or financial management system .  Data on project timeline may be incorrect and budgetary information may be incomplete since all monies committed to or spent on a project may not be captured.  CPDB does capture planned commitments allocated to projects that may never come to fruition; these instances are most frequent for projects funded by discretionary funding sources, such as council member funding.  Currently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of current and planned City capital projects, but the  spatial data are not 100% reliable, accurate, or exhaustive .    The  map of capital projects is incomplete  because many capital projects could not be spatially referenced due to vague descriptions not including the name of a site.      Some projects are mapped incorrectly .  Some projects are geocoded to agency's headquarters rather than the site where the capital investment and construction is taking place.  Other projects are mapped to the wrong site as a result of two places having the same name or similar names. Unfortunately, these records cannot be systematically verified and corrected.    Through user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time.  For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing or sponsor agency.  As a result of these limitations and inconsistencies,  CPDB should not be used for quantitative analyses .  CPDB should be used for planning coordination and information purposes only.\nIf CPDB is used for any spatial analyses it is crucial to recognize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.

Categorize the projects  By matching words in the project's short description to a list of ~600 keywords group the projects into 3 categories:    IT, Vehicles, and Equipment  Any project that can be included in this group is added to this category.    Lump Sum  For allocations of funds that will be drawn from to create new projects.    Fixed Asset  For projects where the work will take place at one or many fixed locations.    Projects that can not be classified into any of these three categories based on keywords in the short description are left as  Unknown .  Mapping the projects  Projects were mapped using three methods:    Agency data  The Department of Design and Construction (DDC), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) all publish spatial data of their capital projects, and each geometry includes the associated FMDID(s).  Therefore, we aggregate the geometries from these data sources to the FMSID and then add these geometries by joining on FMDID.    Algorithms  Often the location of the project is specified in the project's short description.  Using a series of algorithms we are able to extract the specified location, such as a park id or park name, and join on geometries from an existing public data source, such as park properties or the facilities database.    Research  For many projects the location(s) of the project is/are specified in the project's short description, but a geometry cannot be associated with the project by joining to an existing dataset on FMS ID or mapping the project algorithmically.  Therefore, many projects were mapped via manual research, which involved a DCP team member reading the short description of the project and creating a geometry for that projects representing where that project is taking place.  New geometries can be added to CPDB by adding a BIN with the assocaited FMSID to the  id_bin_map.csv , which works best for building based projects, or by creating a geometry using  DCP's Simple Geom Editor  and adding the outputted .json file to the  geometries folder .  We focus mapping projects that have be categorized as a \"Fixed Asset.\"  Agency verified  During the Summer of 2017 we with the support of OMB worked with each capital agency to verify the locations of the projects that we mapped and correct them if they were incorrect, and to map where possible projects that we were not able to map and that we've classified as a \"Fixed Asset\" or \"Unknown\" type of project.  The agency projected new or corrected location information by providing the address, bin, bbl, or other id or the location(s) where that project was taking place   Format table for database consumption  Load .csv onto DCP FTP  Load into database  Create geometries based on BIN, BBL, or bridge id  Create geometries by geocoding addresses  Aggregate geometries to the FMS ID.  Append new or corrected geometries from the  dcp_cpdb_agencyverified  onto the  cpdb_dcpattributes  table and overwrite any existing geometries.     Removing geometries  We make mistakes.  As we've QA/QCed and worked with CPDB if we noticed any project mapped incorrectly we've added the FMSID to the  cpdb_geomsremove.csv .  At the end of the build process geometries for these projects are removed as long as the geometry did not come directly from an agency.  If an agency indicated that a project cannot be mapped now or ever the geometries for these projects were removed.  Standardizing geometries      All buildings are represented as points  Lines are turned into polygons  All geometries are made into multi-geometries   Create master flat file  Run a final .sql script to create the master flat file that aggregates information, such as spending data, to the project level.",
