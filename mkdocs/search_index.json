These facilities generally impact the quality of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and they range across seven domains:\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services\n\n\nEducation, Child Welfare, and Youth\n\n\nParks, Gardens, and Historical Sites\n\n\nLibraries and Cultural Programs\n\n\nPublic Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice\n\n\nCore Infrastructure and Transportation\n\n\nAdministration of Government\n\n\n\n\nThis database and its \ninteractive map\n build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. It captures the location, type, and capacity of public and private facilities in order to inform holistic neighborhood planning, strategic site selection and service delivery planning, opportunities for interagency and public-private partnerships, community outreach activities, and many other functions across City agencies.\nOne goal of this database is to provide a consolidated, authoritative dataset that can serve as a one-stop-shop to planners. More broadly, the intent is to provide the foundation for a more robust data-integration initiative, ensuring interoperability between disparate agencies\u2019 datasets.\n\n\nCity Planning has grouped these facilities according to the seven domains bulleted above. Within each domain, each record is further categorized into a subsequent set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names are pulled directly from source datasets, wherever possible.\n\n\nCurrently, FacDB aggregates and synthesizes data sourced from 43 agencies, recording almost 40,000 facilities throughout NYC. More facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the \nContents and Classification Heirarchy\n section.\n\n\nWe are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n with any suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\n\"Facilities Database \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Facilities Database (FacDB) captures the locations and descriptions of public and private facilities ranging from the provision of social services, recreation, education, to solid waste management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap\n, \nShapefile\n, \nCSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\n02/04/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents and Classification Heirarchy\n\n\nIn order of increasing granularity, each record that is included in the database is classified by DCP into a \nDomain \n Facility Group \n Facility Subgroup \n Facility Type\n. There are around 450 facility types. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description. The tables below describe each of the Subgroups in each of the seven Domains; however, the Facility Types within them are not listed.\n\n\nAdministration of Government Domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility

Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Many records could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the \nMethodology\n.\n\n\nDuplicates.\n Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain atrributes from the most up-to-date and detailed record.\n\n\nAdministrative Addresses.\n There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.\n\n\nAnalysis Limitations.\n As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\nData Processing\n\n\nSince the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the \nNYC Planning GitHub page\n.\n\n\nAssembly.\n\nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.\n\n\nGeoprocessing.\n\nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the \nGeoClient API\n using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.\n\n\nDuplicate Record Removal.\n Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\nThe following table lists and defines each of the fields presented in the Facilities Database as they are organized in the database from left to right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Alias\n\n\nField Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Identifier\n\n\nuid\n\n\nUniversal Unique Identifier.

One table contains all the geocoded records with spatial data, and one with the records which could not be geocoded.\n\n\nIn the future, some supplemental information which is specific to certain facility types will also be included in the database package as relational tables. For exmaple, a table of park attributes or a table with a more granular breakdown of school enrollment by grade could be joined onto the main table using a unique ID.",

            "text": "The City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB) aggregates information about facilities and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York. These facilities generally impact the quality of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, and they range across seven domains:   Health and Human Services  Education, Child Welfare, and Youth  Parks, Gardens, and Historical Sites  Libraries and Cultural Programs  Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice  Core Infrastructure and Transportation  Administration of Government   This database and its  interactive map  build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. It captures the location, type, and capacity of public and private facilities in order to inform holistic neighborhood planning, strategic site selection and service delivery planning, opportunities for interagency and public-private partnerships, community outreach activities, and many other functions across City agencies.\nOne goal of this database is to provide a consolidated, authoritative dataset that can serve as a one-stop-shop to planners. More broadly, the intent is to provide the foundation for a more robust data-integration initiative, ensuring interoperability between disparate agencies\u2019 datasets.  City Planning has grouped these facilities according to the seven domains bulleted above. Within each domain, each record is further categorized into a subsequent set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names are pulled directly from source datasets, wherever possible.  Currently, FacDB aggregates and synthesizes data sourced from 43 agencies, recording almost 40,000 facilities throughout NYC. More facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the  Contents and Classification Heirarchy  section.  We are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov  with any suggestions.

There are around 450 facility types. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.

            "text": "FacDB is only as good as the source data it aggregates. Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Many records could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the  Methodology .  Duplicates.  Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain atrributes from the most up-to-date and detailed record.  Administrative Addresses.  There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.  Analysis Limitations.  As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.  If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov .",

            "text": "Since the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the  NYC Planning GitHub page .  Assembly. \nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.  Geoprocessing. \nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the  GeoClient API  using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.  Duplicate Record Removal.  Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.",
