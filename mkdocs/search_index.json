Overview\n\n\nThe City Planning Facilities Database aggregates more than 35,000 records from 45 different \npublic data sources\n provided by City, State, and Federal agencies. While each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services\n\n\nEducation, Child Welfare, and Youth\n\n\nParks, Gardens, and Historical Sites\n\n\nLibraries and Cultural Programs\n\n\nPublic Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice\n\n\nCore Infrastructure and Transportation\n\n\nAdministration of Government\n\n\n\n\nWithin each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the \nContents and Classification Hierarchy\n section.\n\n\nThis database and its \ninteractive map\n build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. Improvements include more facility types, improved data quality, and a restructured database for easier use. We have also automated our means of refreshing the data from the majority of sources \u2013 we anticipate that the data will be refreshed on at least a quarterly basis (although source datasets may be refreshed less frequently). Please read more about the \nlimitations\n of this data product below.\n\n\nMore facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis.\n\n\nWe are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\n\"Facilities Database \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Facilities Database (FacDB) captures the locations and descriptions of public and private facilities ranging from the provision of social services, recreation, education, to solid waste management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap\n, \nShapefile\n, \nCSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\n05/22/17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII.

There are around 450 facility types. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.

Limitations and Disclaimers\n\n\nThe City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB) is only as good as the source data it aggregates, and the Department of City Planning cannot verify the accuracy of all records. Please read more about specific data and analysis limitations before using this data.\n\n\nAnalysis Limitations.\n As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies listed below, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source dataset\u2019s latest update in the \nSource Data\n section.\n\n\nMissing Records.\n Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded in the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Many records also could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the \nMethodology\n.\n\n\nDuplicates.\n Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain all useful attributes from each record.\n\n\nAdministrative Addresses.\n There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.\n\n\nPublic Accessibility of Sites.\n DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nIV. Methodology\n\n\nData Processing\n\n\nSince the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the \nNYC Planning GitHub page\n.\n\n\nAssembly.\n\nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.\n\n\nGeoprocessing.\n\nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the \nGeoClient API\n using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid, if a BIN could not be assigned and used for the geometry instead. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.\n\n\nDuplicate Record Removal.\n Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.\n\n\n\n\n\nV. Data Dictionary\n\n\nThe following table lists and defines each of the fields presented in the Facilities Database as they are organized in the database from left to right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Alias\n\n\nField Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Identifier\n\n\nuid\n\n\nUniversal Unique Identifier.

If the address that is available for the site is not complete with an address number (only the street name), this field is left blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet Name\n\n\nstreetname\n\n\nThe name of the street where the facility is located, validated by GeoClient. If the address that is available for the site is not complete with an address number (only the street name), this field is left blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress\n\n\naddress\n\n\nThe concatenated value of AddressNumber and StreetName of where the facility is located. If there is not a valid, complete address available, any location description that was provided is included in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity\n\n\ncity\n\n\nThe USPS preferred name of the addressed city where the facility is located. Generated by GeoClient and spatial joins. This field contains some blanks for facilities that do not overlap with the shoreline Zip Code boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorough\n\n\nboro\n\n\nThe full name the borough the facility is within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorough Code\n\n\nborocode\n\n\nThe number value representing the borough the facility is within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZIP Code\n\n\nzipcode\n\n\nThe ZIP Code the facility is within. This field contains some blanks for facilities that do not overlap with the shoreline Zip Code boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\nThe latitude of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongitude\n\n\nlongitude\n\n\nThe longitude of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX Coordinate\n\n\nxcoord\n\n\nThe X coordinate of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY Coordinate\n\n\nycoord\n\n\nThe Y coordinate of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIN\n\n\nbin\n\n\nThe \nBIN\n values for the buildings the facility is located in. This field contains blanks, because 1) some lots do not have buildings on them, and 2) some lots have multiple buildings and a single BIN could not be reliably assigned given the information provided in the source data. There may also be cases where a facility is actually comprised by multiple BINs but only one is recorded in FacDB because the others were not be provided in the source data and could not be reliably assumed based on the single address provided for the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBBL\n\n\nbbl\n\n\nThe \nBBL\n values for the tax lots the facility is located on.

            "text": "The City Planning Facilities Database aggregates more than 35,000 records from 45 different  public data sources  provided by City, State, and Federal agencies. While each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:   Health and Human Services  Education, Child Welfare, and Youth  Parks, Gardens, and Historical Sites  Libraries and Cultural Programs  Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice  Core Infrastructure and Transportation  Administration of Government   Within each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the  Contents and Classification Hierarchy  section.  This database and its  interactive map  build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. Improvements include more facility types, improved data quality, and a restructured database for easier use. We have also automated our means of refreshing the data from the majority of sources \u2013 we anticipate that the data will be refreshed on at least a quarterly basis (although source datasets may be refreshed less frequently). Please read more about the  limitations  of this data product below.  More facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis.  We are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov .",

Please read more about specific data and analysis limitations before using this data.  Analysis Limitations.  As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies listed below, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source dataset\u2019s latest update in the  Source Data  section.  Missing Records.  Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded in the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Many records also could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the  Methodology .  Duplicates.  Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain all useful attributes from each record.  Administrative Addresses.  There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.  Public Accessibility of Sites.  DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.  If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov .",

The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the  NYC Planning GitHub page .  Assembly. \nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.  Geoprocessing. \nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the  GeoClient API  using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid, if a BIN could not be assigned and used for the geometry instead. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.  Duplicate Record Removal.  Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.",

By capturing the location and timeline for capital projects CPDB enables citywide analyses of investments over time and space, and provides a central data source for agencies to evaluate synergies among projects.\n\n\nCurrently, CPDB aggregates and synthesizes spatial data from five NYC capital agencies, recording more than 10,000 past, present, and planned NYC capital projects occurring throughout NYC.  As new data become available these data will be processes and integrated into CPDB.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n| General information |\n| :------------: | ------------- |\n| Description | The Capital Planning Database (CPDB) captures key data points on past, present, and planned capital projects in and around New York City (NYC) sponsored or managed by a capital agency |\n| Data format | GeoJSON, shapefile, csv |\n| Projection | WGS84 |\n| Date last updated | 08/15/16 |\n\n\nDatabase structure\n\n\nThree tables compose CPDB: Projects, Sites, and Budget.\n\n\nA project is defined as an investment or series of investments made by a capital agency.  A project can span multiple sites and can be funded by multiple funding sources, but all other attributes, such as cost and timeline, remain constant.  The projects data is composed of data derived from the source datasets.\n\n\nA site is a single location where a project or portion of a project is taking place.  Many sites can makeup one project, but each project occurring at a single site is reflected as an individual record in the sites table.\n\n\nThe budget is each line item from the City's Financial Management System (FMS).  FMS tracks the City's budget and spend.  If an FMS ID is provided for a project it can be linked an FMS line item.\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Alias\n\n\nField Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Unique Identifier\n\n\nguid\n\n\nUniversal Unique Identifier.
