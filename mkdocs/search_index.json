Overview\n\n\nThe City Planning Facilities Database aggregates more than 35,000 records from 45 different \npublic data sources\n provided by City, State, and Federal agencies. While each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services\n\n\nEducation, Child Welfare, and Youth\n\n\nParks, Gardens, and Historical Sites\n\n\nLibraries and Cultural Programs\n\n\nPublic Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice\n\n\nCore Infrastructure and Transportation\n\n\nAdministration of Government\n\n\n\n\nWithin each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the \nContents and Classification Hierarchy\n section.\n\n\nThis database and its \ninteractive map\n build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. Improvements include more facility types, improved data quality, and a restructured database for easier use. We have also automated our means of refreshing the data from the majority of sources \u2013 we anticipate that the data will be refreshed on at least a quarterly basis (although source datasets may be refreshed less frequently). Please read more about the \nlimitations\n of this data product below.\n\n\nMore facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis.\n\n\nWe are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\n\"Facilities Database \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Facilities Database (FacDB) captures the locations and descriptions of public and private facilities ranging from the provision of social services, recreation, education, to solid waste management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap\n, \nShapefile\n, \nCSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\n05/22/17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII.

There are around 450 facility types. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.

Limitations and Disclaimers\n\n\nThe City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB) is only as good as the source data it aggregates, and the Department of City Planning cannot verify the accuracy of all records. Please read more about specific data and analysis limitations before using this data.\n\n\nAnalysis Limitations.\n As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies listed below, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source dataset\u2019s latest update in the \nSource Data\n section.\n\n\nMissing Records.\n Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded in the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Many records also could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the \nMethodology\n.\n\n\nDuplicates.\n Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain all useful attributes from each record.\n\n\nAdministrative Addresses.\n There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.\n\n\nPublic Accessibility of Sites.\n DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapital@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nIV. Methodology\n\n\nData Processing\n\n\nSince the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the \nNYC Planning GitHub page\n.\n\n\nAssembly.\n\nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.\n\n\nGeoprocessing.\n\nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the \nGeoClient API\n using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid, if a BIN could not be assigned and used for the geometry instead. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.\n\n\nDuplicate Record Removal.\n Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.\n\n\n\n\n\nV. Data Dictionary\n\n\nThe following table lists and defines each of the fields presented in the Facilities Database as they are organized in the database from left to right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Alias\n\n\nField Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique Identifier\n\n\nuid\n\n\nUniversal Unique Identifier.

If the address that is available for the site is not complete with an address number (only the street name), this field is left blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet Name\n\n\nstreetname\n\n\nThe name of the street where the facility is located, validated by GeoClient. If the address that is available for the site is not complete with an address number (only the street name), this field is left blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress\n\n\naddress\n\n\nThe concatenated value of AddressNumber and StreetName of where the facility is located. If there is not a valid, complete address available, any location description that was provided is included in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity\n\n\ncity\n\n\nThe USPS preferred name of the addressed city where the facility is located. Generated by GeoClient and spatial joins. This field contains some blanks for facilities that do not overlap with the shoreline Zip Code boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorough\n\n\nboro\n\n\nThe full name the borough the facility is within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorough Code\n\n\nborocode\n\n\nThe number value representing the borough the facility is within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZIP Code\n\n\nzipcode\n\n\nThe ZIP Code the facility is within. This field contains some blanks for facilities that do not overlap with the shoreline Zip Code boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\nThe latitude of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongitude\n\n\nlongitude\n\n\nThe longitude of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX Coordinate\n\n\nxcoord\n\n\nThe X coordinate of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY Coordinate\n\n\nycoord\n\n\nThe Y coordinate of the location either calculated using the coordinates in the source data or provided by GeoClient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIN\n\n\nbin\n\n\nThe \nBIN\n values for the buildings the facility is located in. This field contains blanks, because 1) some lots do not have buildings on them, and 2) some lots have multiple buildings and a single BIN could not be reliably assigned given the information provided in the source data. There may also be cases where a facility is actually comprised by multiple BINs but only one is recorded in FacDB because the others were not be provided in the source data and could not be reliably assumed based on the single address provided for the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBBL\n\n\nbbl\n\n\nThe \nBBL\n values for the tax lots the facility is located on.

While each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:   Health and Human Services  Education, Child Welfare, and Youth  Parks, Gardens, and Historical Sites  Libraries and Cultural Programs  Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice  Core Infrastructure and Transportation  Administration of Government   Within each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the  Contents and Classification Hierarchy  section.  This database and its  interactive map  build upon City Planning\u2019s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. Improvements include more facility types, improved data quality, and a restructured database for easier use. We have also automated our means of refreshing the data from the majority of sources \u2013 we anticipate that the data will be refreshed on at least a quarterly basis (although source datasets may be refreshed less frequently). Please read more about the  limitations  of this data product below.  More facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis.  We are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov .",

Please read more about specific data and analysis limitations before using this data.  Analysis Limitations.  As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies listed below, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source dataset\u2019s latest update in the  Source Data  section.  Missing Records.  Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded in the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Many records also could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the  Methodology .  Duplicates.  Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain all useful attributes from each record.  Administrative Addresses.  There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.  Public Accessibility of Sites.  DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.  If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at  Capital@planning.nyc.gov .",

The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the  NYC Planning GitHub page .  Assembly. \nFirst, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.  Geoprocessing. \nMany of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the  GeoClient API  using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid, if a BIN could not be assigned and used for the geometry instead. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.  Duplicate Record Removal.  Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.",

Other open data resources are also leveraged to map the capital projects.\n\n\nCPDB supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York City\u2019s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning.\n\n\nI. Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\n\n\n\"Capital Projects Database\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Capital Projects Database (CPDB) captures key data points on, including spatial data, potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData format\n\n\nWebmap\n, Shapefile: \nPoints\n \n \nPolygons\n, GeoJSON: \nPoints\n \n \nPolygons\n, \nCSV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nWGS84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate last updated\n\n\nSeptember 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Commitment Plan version\n\n\nApril 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Limitations and Disclaimers\n\n\nCPDB is only as good as the source data it extracts and aggregates; therefore, CPDB includes data on current and planned NYC capital projects reported in OMB's Capital Commitment Plan and it does not capture all historic, current, or future capital projects.  \n\n\nCPDB is not a project or financial management system\n.  Data on project timeline may be incorrect and budgetary information may be incomplete since all monies committed to or spent on a project may not be captured.  CPDB does capture planned commitments allocated to projects that may never come to fruition; these instances are most frequent for projects funded by discretionary funding sources, such as council member funding.\n\n\nCurrently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of current and planned City capital projects, but the \nspatial data are not 100% reliable, accurate, or exhaustive\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmap of capital projects is incomplete\n because many capital projects could not be spatially referenced due to vague descriptions not including the name of a site.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome projects are mapped incorrectly\n.  Some projects are geocoded to agency's headquarters rather than the site where the capital investment and construction is taking place.  Other projects are mapped to the wrong site as a result of two places having the same name or similar names. Unfortunately, these records cannot be systematically verified and corrected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time.\n\n\nFor more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing or sponsor agency.\n\n\nAs a result of these limitations and inconsistencies, \nCPDB should not be used for quantitative analyses\n.  CPDB should be used for planning coordination and information purposes only.\nIf CPDB is used for any spatial analyses it is crucial to recognize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at \nCapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov\n.\n\n\nIII. Methodology\n\n\nBuilding CPDB\n\n\nLoading data dependencies\n\n\nNumerous datasets are required to build CPDB, so these are loaded into the database first.  Most of these datasets are public.\n\n\nGet raw data and choose primary data source\n\n\nCPDB can be built using the public data obtained from the Capital Commitments Plans published by OMB or the data from FMS supplied by FISA.\n\n\nCapital Commitments Plan PDFs\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDFs\n\n\nScrape data from PDFs\n\n\nLoad raw data table into database as omb_capitalcommitments\n\n\n\n\nFMS data from FISA\n\n\n\n\nDownload data from FISA FTP\n\n\nTransform .asc file to .csv file\n\n\nUpload .csv to DCP FTP\n\n\nLoad raw data table into database as fisa_capitalcommitments\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the primary data source in the \ncpdb.config.json\n file.  The default primary data source is \nomb_capitalcommitments\n.\n\n\nCreate the CPDB base tables\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpdb_projects\n\n\nA project is defined as a unique FMSID\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpdb_budgets\n\n\nA budget is a unique budget line.  Many budgets can fund one one project and many projects are funded by one budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpdb_commitments\n\n\nA commitment is an individual planned commitment.  Multiple planned commitments fund one project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese base tables report the data at the three different levels.\n\n\nDeveloping the \ncpdb_dcpattributes\n table\n\n\nThis table contains all of DCP's value adds to the raw data, such as classifying and mapping the projects.\n\n\nCategorize the projects\n\n\nBy matching words in the project's short description to a list of ~600 keywords group the projects into 3 categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT, Vehicles, and Equipment\n\n\nAny project that can be included in this group is added to this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLump Sum\n\n\nFor allocations of funds that will be drawn from to create new projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed Asset\n\n\nFor projects where the work will take place at one or many fixed locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects that can not be classified into any of these three categories based on keywords in the short description are left as \nUnknown\n.\n\n\nMapping the projects\n\n\nProjects were mapped using three methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency data\n\n\nThe Department of Design and Construction (DDC), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) all publish spatial data of their capital projects, and each geometry includes the associated FMDID(s).  Therefore, we aggregate the geometries from these data sources to the FMSID and then add these geometries by joining on FMDID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms\n\n\nOften the location of the project is specified in the project's short description.  Using a series of algorithms we are able to extract the specified location, such as a park id or park name, and join on geometries from an existing public data source, such as park properties or the facilities database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nFor many projects the location(s) of the project is/are specified in the project's short description, but a geometry cannot be associated with the project by joining to an existing dataset on FMS ID or mapping the project algorithmically.  Therefore, many projects were mapped via manual research, which involved a DCP team member reading the short description of the project and creating a geometry for that projects representing where that project is taking place.\n\n\nNew geometries can be added to CPDB by adding a BIN with the assocaited FMSID to the \nid_bin_map.csv\n, which works best for building based projects, or by creating a geometry using \nDCP's Simple Geom Editor\n and adding the outputted .json file to the \ngeometries folder\n.\n\n\nWe focus mapping projects that have be categorized as a \"Fixed Asset.\"\n\n\nAgency verified\n\n\nDuring the Summer of 2017 we with the support of OMB worked with each capital agency to verify the locations of the projects that we mapped and correct them if they were incorrect, and to map where possible projects that we were not able to map and that we've classified as a \"Fixed Asset\" or \"Unknown\" type of project.\n\n\nThe agency projected new or corrected location information by providing the address, bin, bbl, or other id or the location(s) where that project was taking place\n\n\n\n\nFormat table for database consumption\n\n\nLoad .csv onto DCP FTP\n\n\nLoad into database\n\n\nCreate geometries based on BIN, BBL, or bridge id\n\n\nCreate geometries by geocoding addresses\n\n\nAggregate geometries to the FMS ID.\n\n\nAppend new or corrected geometries from the \ndcp_cpdb_agencyverified\n onto the \ncpdb_dcpattributes\n table and overwrite any existing geometries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving geometries\n\n\nWe make mistakes.  As we've QA/QCed and worked with CPDB if we noticed any project mapped incorrectly we've added the FMSID to the \ncpdb_geomsremove.csv\n.  At the end of the build process geometries for these projects are removed as long as the geometry did not come directly from an agency.\n\n\nIf an agency indicated that a project cannot be mapped now or ever the geometries for these projects were removed.\n\n\nStandardizing geometries\n  \n\n\n\n\nAll buildings are represented as points\n\n\nLines are turned into polygons\n\n\nAll geometries are made into multi-geometries\n\n\n\n\nCreate master flat file\n\n\nRun a final .sql script to create the master flat file that aggregates information, such as spending data, to the project level.\n\n\nUpdating the production data tables for the Capital Projects Explorer\n\n\n\n\nOutput 4 .csv files and 2 .shp files from the database.\n\n\nUpload the files to the CartoProd server.\n\n\ncpdb_projects.csv\n\n\ncpdb_budgets.csv\n\n\ncpdb_commitments.csv\n\n\ncpdb_projects_combined.csv\n\n\ncpdb_dcpattributes_pts.shp\n\n\ncpdb_dcpattributes_poly.shp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun one final SQL script in Carto to create array fields and create new table named cpdb_projects_combined from output.\n\n\nPoint Explorer to reference latest datasets\n\n\n\n\nIV. Data Dictionary\n\n\nThe source data used to build CPDB determines what attributes are reported by the final product.  Using FMS data from FISA provides the greatest level of detail and accuracy, and outputs the most attributes.

Information reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) three times per year is the foundation that CPDB is then built off of; therefore, only the capital projects that appear in the Capital Commitment Plan are reflected in CPDB.  Other open data resources are also leveraged to map the capital projects.  CPDB supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York City\u2019s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning.",

CPDB is not a project or financial management system .  Data on project timeline may be incorrect and budgetary information may be incomplete since all monies committed to or spent on a project may not be captured.  CPDB does capture planned commitments allocated to projects that may never come to fruition; these instances are most frequent for projects funded by discretionary funding sources, such as council member funding.  Currently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of current and planned City capital projects, but the  spatial data are not 100% reliable, accurate, or exhaustive .    The  map of capital projects is incomplete  because many capital projects could not be spatially referenced due to vague descriptions not including the name of a site.      Some projects are mapped incorrectly .  Some projects are geocoded to agency's headquarters rather than the site where the capital investment and construction is taking place.  Other projects are mapped to the wrong site as a result of two places having the same name or similar names. Unfortunately, these records cannot be systematically verified and corrected.    Through user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time.  For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing or sponsor agency.  As a result of these limitations and inconsistencies,  CPDB should not be used for quantitative analyses .  CPDB should be used for planning coordination and information purposes only.\nIf CPDB is used for any spatial analyses it is crucial to recognize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive.

Categorize the projects  By matching words in the project's short description to a list of ~600 keywords group the projects into 3 categories:    IT, Vehicles, and Equipment  Any project that can be included in this group is added to this category.    Lump Sum  For allocations of funds that will be drawn from to create new projects.    Fixed Asset  For projects where the work will take place at one or many fixed locations.    Projects that can not be classified into any of these three categories based on keywords in the short description are left as  Unknown .  Mapping the projects  Projects were mapped using three methods:    Agency data  The Department of Design and Construction (DDC), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) all publish spatial data of their capital projects, and each geometry includes the associated FMDID(s).  Therefore, we aggregate the geometries from these data sources to the FMSID and then add these geometries by joining on FMDID.    Algorithms  Often the location of the project is specified in the project's short description.  Using a series of algorithms we are able to extract the specified location, such as a park id or park name, and join on geometries from an existing public data source, such as park properties or the facilities database.    Research  For many projects the location(s) of the project is/are specified in the project's short description, but a geometry cannot be associated with the project by joining to an existing dataset on FMS ID or mapping the project algorithmically.  Therefore, many projects were mapped via manual research, which involved a DCP team member reading the short description of the project and creating a geometry for that projects representing where that project is taking place.  New geometries can be added to CPDB by adding a BIN with the assocaited FMSID to the  id_bin_map.csv , which works best for building based projects, or by creating a geometry using  DCP's Simple Geom Editor  and adding the outputted .json file to the  geometries folder .  We focus mapping projects that have be categorized as a \"Fixed Asset.\"  Agency verified  During the Summer of 2017 we with the support of OMB worked with each capital agency to verify the locations of the projects that we mapped and correct them if they were incorrect, and to map where possible projects that we were not able to map and that we've classified as a \"Fixed Asset\" or \"Unknown\" type of project.  The agency projected new or corrected location information by providing the address, bin, bbl, or other id or the location(s) where that project was taking place   Format table for database consumption  Load .csv onto DCP FTP  Load into database  Create geometries based on BIN, BBL, or bridge id  Create geometries by geocoding addresses  Aggregate geometries to the FMS ID.  Append new or corrected geometries from the  dcp_cpdb_agencyverified  onto the  cpdb_dcpattributes  table and overwrite any existing geometries.     Removing geometries  We make mistakes.  As we've QA/QCed and worked with CPDB if we noticed any project mapped incorrectly we've added the FMSID to the  cpdb_geomsremove.csv .  At the end of the build process geometries for these projects are removed as long as the geometry did not come directly from an agency.  If an agency indicated that a project cannot be mapped now or ever the geometries for these projects were removed.  Standardizing geometries      All buildings are represented as points  Lines are turned into polygons  All geometries are made into multi-geometries   Create master flat file  Run a final .sql script to create the master flat file that aggregates information, such as spending data, to the project level.",
