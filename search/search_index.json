Information reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) three times per year is the foundation that CPDB is then built off of; therefore, only the capital projects that appear in the Capital Commitment Plan are reflected in CPDB. Other open data resources are also leveraged to map the capital projects. CPDB supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York City\u2019s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning. I. Overview Dataset Name \"Capital Projects Database\" Description The Capital Projects Database (CPDB) captures key data points on, including spatial data, potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Data format Webmap , Shapefile: Points & Polygons , GeoJSON: Points & Polygons , CSV Projection WGS84 Date last updated March 2020 Capital Commitment Plan version January 2020 II. Limitations and Disclaimers CPDB is only as good as the source data it extracts and aggregates; therefore, CPDB includes data on current and planned NYC capital projects reported in OMB's Capital Commitment Plan and it does not capture all historic, current, or future capital projects. CPDB is not a project or financial management system . Data on project timeline may be incorrect and budgetary information may be incomplete since all monies committed to or spent on a project may not be captured. CPDB does capture planned commitments allocated to projects that may never come to fruition; these instances are most frequent for projects funded by discretionary funding sources, such as council member funding. Currently, CPDB is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of current and planned City capital projects, but the spatial data are not 100% reliable, accurate, or exhaustive . The map of capital projects is incomplete because many capital projects could not be spatially referenced due to vague descriptions not including the name of a site. Some projects are mapped incorrectly . Some projects are geocoded to agency's headquarters rather than the site where the capital investment and construction is taking place. Other projects are mapped to the wrong site as a result of two places having the same name or similar names. Unfortunately, these records cannot be systematically verified and corrected. Through user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time. For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing or sponsor agency. As a result of these limitations and inconsistencies, CPDB should not be used for quantitative analyses . CPDB should be used for planning coordination and information purposes only. If CPDB is used for any spatial analyses it is crucial to recognize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov . III. Methodology Building CPDB Loading data dependencies Numerous datasets are required to build CPDB, so these are loaded into the database first. Most of these datasets are public. Get raw data and choose primary data source CPDB can be built using the public data obtained from the Capital Commitments Plans published by OMB or the data from FMS supplied by FISA. Capital Commitments Plan PDFs Download PDFs Scrape data from PDFs Load raw data table into database as omb_capitalcommitments FMS data from FISA Download data from FISA FTP Transform .asc file to .csv file Upload .csv to DCP FTP Load raw data table into database as fisa_capitalcommitments Specify the primary data source in the cpdb.config.json file. The default primary data source is omb_capitalcommitments . Create the CPDB base tables cpdb_projects A project is defined as a unique FMSID cpdb_budgets A budget is a unique budget line. Many budgets can fund one one project and many projects are funded by one budget. cpdb_commitments A commitment is an individual planned commitment. Multiple planned commitments fund one project. These base tables report the data at the three different levels. Developing the cpdb_dcpattributes table This table contains all of DCP's value adds to the raw data, such as classifying and mapping the projects. Categorize the projects By matching words in the project's short description to a list of ~600 keywords group the projects into 3 categories: IT, Vehicles, and Equipment Any project that can be included in this group is added to this category. Lump Sum For allocations of funds that will be drawn from to create new projects. Fixed Asset For projects where the work will take place at one or many fixed locations. Projects that can not be classified into any of these three categories based on keywords in the short description are left as Unknown . Mapping the projects Projects were mapped using three methods: Agency data The Department of Design and Construction (DDC), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) all publish spatial data of their capital projects, and each geometry includes the associated FMDID(s). Therefore, we aggregate the geometries from these data sources to the FMSID and then add these geometries by joining on FMDID. Algorithms Often the location of the project is specified in the project's short description. Using a series of algorithms we are able to extract the specified location, such as a park id or park name, and join on geometries from an existing public data source, such as park properties or the facilities database. Research For many projects the location(s) of the project is/are specified in the project's short description, but a geometry cannot be associated with the project by joining to an existing dataset on FMS ID or mapping the project algorithmically. Therefore, many projects were mapped via manual research, which involved a DCP team member reading the short description of the project and creating a geometry for that projects representing where that project is taking place. New geometries can be added to CPDB by adding a BIN with the assocaited FMSID to the id_bin_map.csv , which works best for building based projects, or by creating a geometry using DCP's Simple Geom Editor and adding the outputted .json file to the geometries folder . We focus mapping projects that have be categorized as a \"Fixed Asset.\" Agency verified During the Summer of 2017 we with the support of OMB worked with each capital agency to verify the locations of the projects that we mapped and correct them if they were incorrect, and to map where possible projects that we were not able to map and that we've classified as a \"Fixed Asset\" or \"Unknown\" type of project. The agency projected new or corrected location information by providing the address, bin, bbl, or other id or the location(s) where that project was taking place Format table for database consumption Load .csv onto DCP FTP Load into database Create geometries based on BIN, BBL, or bridge id Create geometries by geocoding addresses Aggregate geometries to the FMS ID. Append new or corrected geometries from the dcp_cpdb_agencyverified onto the cpdb_dcpattributes table and overwrite any existing geometries. Removing geometries We make mistakes. As we've QA/QCed and worked with CPDB if we noticed any project mapped incorrectly we've added the FMSID to the cpdb_geomsremove.csv . At the end of the build process geometries for these projects are removed as long as the geometry did not come directly from an agency. If an agency indicated that a project cannot be mapped now or ever the geometries for these projects were removed. Standardizing geometries All buildings are represented as points Lines are turned into polygons All geometries are made into multi-geometries Create master flat file Run a final .sql script to create the master flat file that aggregates information, such as spending data, to the project level. Updating the production data tables for the Capital Projects Explorer Output 4 .csv files and 2 .shp files from the database. Upload the files to the CartoProd server. cpdb_projects.csv cpdb_budgets.csv cpdb_commitments.csv cpdb_projects_combined.csv cpdb_dcpattributes_pts.shp cpdb_dcpattributes_poly.shp Run one final SQL script in Carto to create array fields and create new table named cpdb_projects_combined from output. Point Explorer to reference latest datasets IV. Data Dictionary The source data used to build CPDB determines what attributes are reported by the final product.

into one database and map-based data explorer. The Capital Projects Explorer\u2019s primary purpose is to provide a common operational picture to capital planners and budget staff across City agencies, which can in turn minimize conflicts among different agencies\u2019 capital projects, maximize opportunities for coordinated capital investment planning and funding alignment, and provide a starting point for integrated neighborhood-based planning. This is certainly not a complete map of capital construction sites funded by NYC, but the Capital Projects Explorer is currently the best starting point for exploring capital projects in NYC. Special thanks to the NYC Departments of Parks and Recreation, Transportation, Design and Construction, the School Construction Authority, and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Recovery and Resiliency for publishing spatial data on capital projects. Overview | General information | | :------------: | ------------- | | Dataset name | \"Capital Projects Explorer\" | Description | The Capital Projects Explorer captures high-level information on past, present, and planned capital projects in NYC by aggregating spatial data on capital projects published by capital agencies. | | Data format | Webmap, GeoJSON, Shapefile, CSV | | Projection | WGS84 | | Date last updated | 10/28/16 | Limitations and Disclaimers The Capital Projects Explorer is only as good as the source data it aggregates. Currently, there is no data standard for capital project mapping and agencies are not required to map their capital projects; therefore, the Capital Projects Explorer makes some assumptions to aggregate and normalize the data into one data table. As a result, this data source has some major limitations. Duplicates This version of the Capital Projects Explorer includes some duplicate records for the same capital project because some of the source datasets have overlapping content, but different unique identifiers for a project, making it difficult to systematically identify and reconcile duplicate records. Inconsistent data standards Capital agencies manage their capital projects data separately and have varying data standards that meet their needs; therefore, the Capital Projects Explorer makes some assumptions to reconcile key common attributes across datasets and integrate the data into one database. Project definition Capital agencies define capital projects differently; therefore, the projects in this explorer vary in size, scope, and impact. The inconsistent definition of a capital project has the potential to skew analyses generated from these data - e.g. comparing the number of capital projects in or amount of funding dedicated to a neighborhood to another con produce misleading results. Completeness This dataset does not capture the entirety of NYC's Capital Budget. The Capital Projects Explorer is built using records from agencies' project management systems, which do not always maintain a link to budget lines, making it impossible to account for the whole Capital Budget. Different update frequencies Data from source agencies are updated at various frequencies, ranging from daily updates to infrequent updates. As a result, the freshness of the data in the Capital Projects Explorer varies depending on the data source. As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies, the Capital Projects Explorer is not an analysis tool, it does not report any metrics, and the data should not be used for quantitative analyses - it is built for planning coordination purposes only. Please consult NYC Planning\u2019s Capital Planning Docs for more details about these data limitations. Methodology Data Processing The Capital Projects Explorer aggregates records from numerous datasets designed for different purposes; therefore, the data need to undergo several stages of transformation before being integrated into the single table. The stages are described below and all of the data processing scripts used are available on the NYC Planning GitHub page. Assembly. First, the desired columns in the source data are mapped to the fields in the Capital Projects Explorer's data schema. Second, the source data values are formatted to match the datatype of the corresponding field. Next, source data values are standardized before being loaded into the Capital Projects Explorer. Data standardization mostly occurs in the managing agency, sponsor agency, and current status fields. Lastly, missing data points are identified and filled in if it is possible to derive the missing values from other existing data attributes. Geoprocessing. The format of the source datasets vary. If the source data are not in a spatial data format spatial data was created for the Capital Projects Explorer. The process of creating spatial data varies by source dataset but generally it involves joining the source dataset to an existing spatial dataset by a common data attribute. Duplicate record removal. Several source datasets have overlapping content. Duplicate records are identified and reconciled when two or more records shared the same FMS ID. If two or more records share the same FMS ID the record from the most authoritative data source is kept. The authoritative ranking of data sources is 1) DDC 2) DOT 3) DPR 4) SCA 5) ORR with DDC being the most authoritative data source.

NYC Planning adds value to the data extracted from the Capital Commitment Plan by linking these projects to data from the FY 17 Capital Budget and Checkbook NYC , and making geometries where possible for projects within the Capital Commitment Plan creating a map of the City's planned capital investments footprint. The Capital Projects Explorer is a starting point for planners exploring what capital projects are taking place within an area, means to identify potential conflicts and synergies among capital projects, and resource for all City agencies to learn more about capital projects by providing easy access to high level information on planned capital projects. This tool and associated data can help to foster interagency coordination and advance neighborhood-based planning, reducing situations of project conflicts and increasing opportunities to capitalize on project synderies, and support strategic capital investment planning across City agencies. The primary function of the Capital Projects Explorer is to enable a user to easily access information about the capital budget, view all of the capital projects with spatial data on one map, explore key data points associated with a capital project. This document provides key information about the Capital Projects Database, the data resource powering the Capital Projects Explorer. We are constantly seeking feedback on how to improve and make this data resource most valuable. Please reach out to the NYC Planning Capital Planning team at Capital@planning.nyc.gov with any suggestions or comments. Overview | General information | | :------------: | ------------- | | Dataset name | \"Capital Projects Database\" | Description | The Capital Projects Database captures high-level information on planned capital projects that appear in the FY 17 NYC Capital Commitment Plan published in October 2016, links these projects to data from the FY 17 Capital Budget and Checkbook NYC, and if possible spatially references the capital projects | | Data format | Webmap, GeoJSON, Shapefile, CSV | | Projection | WGS84 | | Date last updated | 10/28/16 | Limitations and Disclaimers The Capital Projects Database is only as good as the source data it extracts and aggregates. Currently, the Capital Projects Database is the most comprehensive spatial data resource of planned City capital construction sites, but it does claim to capture all historic, current, or future City capital construction sites. Many capital projects could not be spatially referenced because of limited discriptions; therefore, the map of capital projects is incomplete. Also, there are known cases of projects being geocoded to office headquarters, rather than the site where the capital investment is being made; unfortunately, these records could not by systematically verified and corrected. Through user feedback we look to resolve these limitation over time. Analyses Limitations: As a result of these data limitations users should be careful in how they use these data in any analysis, espically spatial analyses. For example: An analysis or comparision of number of projects planned for an area or total dollars planned to be spent in across neighborhoods should recgonize that not all of the projects are spatially referenced, projects may be incorrectly spatially referenced, one project can span across many locations, and this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at CapitalPlanning_DL@planning.nyc.gov . For more detailed information on a specific capital project please reach out to the respective managing agency. Methodology The Capital Projects Database is based on data extracted from the fiscal year 2017 Capital Commitment Plan released in October 2016, which is published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in a .pdf format in four volumes. To transform a .pdf into a spatial database several steps need to be taken to extract the data from the pdfs, link the data to other datasets, and georeference captial projects. Each of the data processing scripts used to create the Capital Projects Database as well as instructions on how to build the database are available on NYC Planning's GitHub . Data scraping A JavaScript script was written and used to extract the budget line, FMS number, managing agency, project ID, description, cost description, city dollars committed, non-city dollars committed, and the planned commit date for each commitment in each volume of the fiscal year 2017 Capital Commitment Plan and write these key data points to an output .csv file. The four .csv files outputted by the data scraping script were merged into a single .csv file, which was then loaded into PostGIS, which will be known as the commitments master table Creating the database tables Projects: A project is defined as being a distinct capital investment, which is identified by having a unique managing agency and project ID in FMS. The combination of managing agency and project ID will be referred to as MA Project ID. The Projects table reports information at the project level. To create the project table unique MA Project ID were extracted from the commitments master table, along with the longest description associated with each unique MA Project ID, as well as the sum of city dollars committed and the sum of non-city dollars committed for each MA Project ID. Since the three digit managing agency is not intuitive managing agency acronym and managing agency name fields were added to the Projects table. The two fields were populated via a lookup table that contains the agency acronym and agency name associated with each agency code. Commitments: A commitment is defined as an individual amount of money that funds a project that draws from one budget and has a planned commit date. The Commitments table has a many-to-one relationship with Projects, and is linked by MA Project ID, which means that many commitments are associated with one project. To create the Commitments table unique MA Project ID, budget line, cost description, planned commit date were extracted from the commitments master table, along with the sum of city dollars committed and the sum of non-city dollars committed for each of the commitments. Budgets: A budget is defined as a large sum of money in which funds are drawn from and allocated towards projects via commitments. The Budget table has a many-to-one relationship with Projects, and is linked by MA Project ID, meaning that many budgets can fund one project. To create the Budgets table unique MA Project ID and budget line were extracted from the commitments master table, along with the sum of city dollars committed and the sum of non-city dollars committed for each of the MA Project ID and budget lines. The fields project type , sponsor agency acronym , and sponsor agency name were added to the Budgets table. The three fields were populated via a lookup table that contains the agency acronym, agency name, and project type associated with each project type code, which is the first one or two letters of the budget line. A total cost field was added to each of the three tables and the sum of the city dollars and non-city dollars was used to generate each of the total cost fields in the Project, Commitments, and Budgets tables. One goal of the Capital Planning Database is to map capital projects; therefore, spatial data needed to be created for each project where possible. To distinguish between data attributes that were directly derived from the 2017 Capital Commitment Plan and data attributes that were created by NYC Planning the table DCP Attributes was created by extracting the managing agency, project ID, MA Project ID, and description from the Projects table. The following fields were added to the DCP Attributes table: Location Status Geometry Geom Source Geom Source Dataset Geom Source Agency BBL BIN Segment ID Park ID Date Edited A description of each of these fields as well as attribute values can be found in the Data Dictionary section of this document. The purpose of these fields is to store geographic data points and track where the geographic came from or how the spatial data were generated. Adding geographic data To track what projects could / could not be georeferenced capital projects were classified as having one of four different location statuses: single site (discrete), multi-site (nondiscrete), sites tbd (tbd), and nonspatial (nonspatial). A single site project is an investment that is taking place at one location, while a multi-site project is an investment that spans two or more locations. If specific sites are not yet known for the investment then the project is classified as 'sites tbd,' while projects that do not have any site specific investments are designated as being nonspatial. Each record was assigned a Location Status. Some projects had their Location Status value populated systematically by pulling out key words from the description field, such as projects that contained \u201ccity wide\u201d or \u201cmulti-site\u201d in the description were marked as \u2018non-discrete,\u2019 or joining the Projects table to other datasets as described below. Still, many of the records were populated manually, which required a person to read the description of the project, determine what the Location Status should be, and update the Location Status value accordingly. Next, several methods were used to generate geographic data. The first and simplest method involved joining on geometries from existing datasets published by other City agencies via MA Project ID or an exact match with the project description. The name of the dataset and the agency that supplied the dataset from which the geometry was derived is noted in the Source Dataset and Source Agency fields in the DCP Attributes table, and the Geom Source field was marked as \u2018Agency.\u2019 To enable better rendering of geometries in Mapbox GL all line geometries were converted to polygons by adding a 15m buffer around each line segment. For projects where the geometry was derived from an exisitng dataset using this first method, if the geometry associated with a project was one point or one polygon the Location Status was updated to be \u2018discrete;\u2019 if the geometry for the project was two or more points or two or more polygons the location status was set to \u2018non-discrete.\u2019 The second method to match geographic data with projects involved several iterations of fuzzy string matching , a technique of finding texts that approximately match a pattern. This method looked to match park IDs, park names, and facility names from the parks properties dataset or facilities database, which have associated geometries, with the project description of projects with a Locaton Status of single site that were still missing a geometry. If a match was found between the Projects table and another source using fuzzy string matching the match was manually verified before the geometry of the project in the Projects table was updated. In these cases the Location Status was set to \u2018discrete,\u2019 the Geom Source was set to \u2018algorithm,\u2019 and the Source Dataset and Source Agency fields were updated with name of the dataset and name of the agency that supplied the data from which the geometry was derived. The third method required a lot of research to be done to add geometries to the remaining projects marked as having a single site Location Status but no geometry. The geometries of these records were populated manually and involved a DCP team member reading the description of the project and to the best of his/her ability give that project a spatial location by assigning it a bbl, bin, segment ID, or park ID. After, the geometries associated with these spatial identifiers (i.e. bbl) were used to update the geometry for these projects DCP Attributes table. If a project could not be tied to an exisiting geometry (i.e. bbl) or the existing geometry was errenous (i.e. a large park) then a DCP team member created a new geometry to represent the project. At this point, all projects with a Location Status of single site have a geometry where it was possible to map that project. Examples of descriptions for \u2018discrete\u2019 projects that were not spatially referenced include \u201cRoof Replacement\u201d and \u201cBio swale #12;\u201d these sites exist but based on the information given the site could not be georeferenced. More work needs to be done to verify geometries created for projects and clean up erroneous geometries; additionally,geometries for projects with a \u2018non-discrete\u2019 or \u2018tbd\u2019 Location Status need to be generated where possible.

A single site project is an investment that is taking place at one location, while a multi-site project is an investment that spans two or more locations. If specific sites are not yet known for the investment then the project is classified as 'sites tbd,' while projects that do not have any site specific investments are designated as being nonspatial. Each record was assigned a Location Status. Some projects had their Location Status value populated systematically by pulling out key words from the description field, such as projects that contained \u201ccity wide\u201d or \u201cmulti-site\u201d in the description were marked as \u2018non-discrete,\u2019 or joining the Projects table to other datasets as described below. Still, many of the records were populated manually, which required a person to read the description of the project, determine what the Location Status should be, and update the Location Status value accordingly. Next, several methods were used to generate geographic data. The first and simplest method involved joining on geometries from existing datasets published by other City agencies via MA Project ID or an exact match with the project description. The name of the dataset and the agency that supplied the dataset from which the geometry was derived is noted in the Source Dataset and Source Agency fields in the DCP Attributes table, and the Geom Source field was marked as \u2018Agency.\u2019 To enable better rendering of geometries in Mapbox GL all line geometries were converted to polygons by adding a 15m buffer around each line segment. For projects where the geometry was derived from an exisitng dataset using this first method, if the geometry associated with a project was one point or one polygon the Location Status was updated to be \u2018discrete;\u2019 if the geometry for the project was two or more points or two or more polygons the location status was set to \u2018non-discrete.\u2019 The second method to match geographic data with projects involved several iterations of fuzzy string matching , a technique of finding texts that approximately match a pattern. This method looked to match park IDs, park names, and facility names from the parks properties dataset or facilities database, which have associated geometries, with the project description of projects with a Locaton Status of single site that were still missing a geometry. If a match was found between the Projects table and another source using fuzzy string matching the match was manually verified before the geometry of the project in the Projects table was updated. In these cases the Location Status was set to \u2018discrete,\u2019 the Geom Source was set to \u2018algorithm,\u2019 and the Source Dataset and Source Agency fields were updated with name of the dataset and name of the agency that supplied the data from which the geometry was derived. The third method required a lot of research to be done to add geometries to the remaining projects marked as having a single site Location Status but no geometry. The geometries of these records were populated manually and involved a DCP team member reading the description of the project and to the best of his/her ability give that project a spatial location by assigning it a bbl, bin, segment ID, or park ID. After, the geometries associated with these spatial identifiers (i.e. bbl) were used to update the geometry for these projects DCP Attributes table. If a project could not be tied to an exisiting geometry (i.e. bbl) or the existing geometry was errenous (i.e. a large park) then a DCP team member created a new geometry to represent the project. At this point, all projects with a Location Status of single site have a geometry where it was possible to map that project. Examples of descriptions for \u2018discrete\u2019 projects that were not spatially referenced include \u201cRoof Replacement\u201d and \u201cBio swale #12;\u201d these sites exist but based on the information given the site could not be georeferenced. More work needs to be done to verify geometries created for projects and clean up erroneous geometries; additionally,geometries for projects with a \u2018non-discrete\u2019 or \u2018tbd\u2019 Location Status need to be generated where possible.","title":"Adding geographic data"},{"location":"cpdbv2/#data-dictionary","text":"The following lists and defines each of the data tables and associated fields in the Capital Projects Database.

Since the source datasets have been maintained by various agencies and updated with different frequencies, datasets are loaded into Amazon s3 as a centralized datahub preparing for the downstream data processing. The list of data sources can be found here . Geoprocessing. When records have address information, spatial data is assigned by taking the centroid of the BIN returned by Geosupport that matches the DoITT building footprints dataset. If a BIN is not available, the latitude and longitude returned by Geosupport is used to create the geometry for the record. If these fields are not available from Geosupport, but the source data has spatial information (i.e. coordinates) the spatial data is created from the source data. If the source data consisted of polygon geometries, the centroid of the polygon was used to assign the geometry for the records in the database. There are cases where the coordinates from the source data fall in the roadbed and not inside a BBL boundary due to the geocoding technique used by the source. Lastly, if a geometry could not be assigned from the BIN, latitude/longitude from Geosupport, or source data, the centroid of the BBL from the clipped MapPLUTO is used. Other geographic information such as the community district is taken from Geosupport if a value is returned, otherwise administrative districts are assigned via spatial joins where the record has a geometry. Duplicate Record Removal. Several of the source datasets have content that overlaps. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records that fall within the same BIN or BBL and have the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency.

Permitted sites are those that have received building permits; although not all of these sites will necessarily be built and completed over the next few years, this category is the City\u2019s best predictor of where new housing will be built in the near future. Sites identified in the \u201cpermit pending\u201d category demonstrate where developers have completed applications for new building (NB) permits or major alterations (A1) permits that will change the number of residential units in a building; these sites may give a general direction of where developers are seeking to deliver new housing units, but since they have not yet received permits, the certainty of their development cannot be assured. In addition to the information derived from permits and Certificates of Occupancy, some records are appended with HPD data regarding the number of affordable housing units. Special thanks goes to the NYC Department of Buildings and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development who make their data available for this map. General information Overview Name \"Residential Pipeline\" Description The Residential Pipeline integrates administrative City data on both new construction and building alterations. Under current methodology, DOB permits are the core dataset around which database is built. Permits are matched with DOB CofOs to determine completion; then, HPD data is then appended (where available) to provide information on the number on City-subsidized, affordable units in each development. Format Webmap, GeoJSON, Shapefile, CSV Projection WGS84 Last updated 10/31/16 Limitations & disclaimers There are a number of known limitations to this dataset and improvements will be made on a continual basis, based on internal reviews and user feedback. Geocoding and geospatial integration ~ 95% DOB permits were successfully geocoding using BBL or address. Geocoding \u2018rejects\u2019 were researched by DCP but not every site could be verified. ~75% of HPD records were matched with their corresponding DOB permit using the BBL listed in each dataset. We assume that all HPD projects should have a corresponding DOB permit, and manual research confirms that most un-matched HPD projects list an outdated BBL. Going forward, DCP will work with HPD to improve and integrate this data. Expired permits These data include permit filings from 2010 through Q3 2016. Some \u201coutstanding\u201d permits (those without Certificate of Occupancy) may have since expired, however, this information not available in current datasets. Going forward, we will seek to identify and exclude expired permits. Exclusions The database excludes likely duplicates and projects with no change in units, as determined by DCP. Duplicates: in some cases, it appeared that multiple permits were generated for a single development. For example, this could occur if an initial permit had administrative errors that were corrected by issuing a new permit. Since the data does not include permit expiration date (per above), we cannot determine if/which permits are outdated. To avoid double-counting, we identified likely duplicates using the Building Identification Number (BIN) listed in the DOB permit. We have only retained the most recent instance of a given BIN in the database. No change in units: In some cases, alteration permits are required for administrative reasons rather than actual construction. To prevent such permits from skewing analyses, we have excluded any alteration permits that are missing data about existing and/or projected number of units. Other data sources For some analyses, it may be appropriate to include likely developments that have not yet received permits (e.g., projects where DCP has approved a land use change, or permits that have been filed but not approved). Due to the uncertainty of such developments, they are not included in this version of the Residential Pipeline. Methodology, key terms and data dictionary This section provides a visual overview of how input datasets are processed and integrated. A glossary of \"key terms\" accompanies this overview, and is intended to aid casual users in understanding the most important concepts. In addition, there is a \"Full data dictionary\" which defines every field in the database. This is intended for users seeking a more detailed understanding of the data, particularly those who intend to use it for analyses.
