Notes
use cases
1) Communications: understand what's going on in a given place - communications - community board budget register - sit down w/ Lester - (AA)
2) Conflict Resulution: inform investment decisions on specific projects right now, (i.e. where there are overlapping jurisdictions of land - DOT and DEP - do analysis now and figure out how to present it) - maybe parks and DOT - buildings that have multile projects going on (how many geometries were created by us for DOT and DEP - by project type geom breakdown - have we mapped DEP stuff before it got to DDC)
3) long term capital planning strategy - equity ananlyses, location status by program

Put together list of examples and location statuses and send to Danny for review and send around for democritization - reagree

1) location status
2) conflict resolution DEP after DOT
3) Communications - what projects are planned for community district

Question: completed projects or projects are in construction 
Funded, under funded, or new need
Each project has an FMS ID that is funded - can map all funded projects
Shape file at BIN
Two stage lookup - FMS then BIN 
Want project desriptions for bridges - resource and how up-to-date?
If there is a conflict project would want to know the type of project
Can give us commitment data 
Can consume as Feature service from DOT
Green has FMS ID
BIN for red and yellow
800 bridges - about 1/2 have projects
Get bridges from Chris' map
Discuss with all the entities
Table view is helpful 
Number of projects in each boro by department - 
Vision zero, OneNYC ca
Economic justice
Contact info more accessible


Milestones
	1) Update scraper
	2) Create 4 tables for January plan w/ empty fields
	3) Documenting assumptions for autmating DCP attributes 1 - 4
	3) First pass of filling in DCP attribute fields 1 - 4 - build queries
	3) Share agency spcific assumptions with agencies for review and confirming it


Miachel and Kara
1) does IFA get captured in checkbook NYC?
- incorporate 4 letter codes to know if it's IFA or...?
- mapping aspect is most useful 
- get regular requests for what's going on in x neighborhood -> current process sucks
- would use capital commitment plan as base
- historical data
- legend by sponsor agency
- indicate funding breakdown (federal, council)
- inform if underfunded
- get preliminary cpi data / opportunity to get info via CPI -> have to influence agencies


-- check 100 gold street
-- DOB on my block - sucks
-- DDC near me - terrible idea don't go near this
-- Front end planning has checklist 
-- Follow-up meeting - how they can help, how they can use it, will use capital project map
-- DDC Comissioner has asked to geocode projects
