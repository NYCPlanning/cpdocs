<p>The Facilities Database (FacDB), a data product produced by the New York City Department of City Planning (NYC Planning) Capital Planning team, captures the location, type, and capacity of public and private facilities ranging across six domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health Care and Human Services</li>
<li>Youth, Education, and Child Welfare</li>
<li>Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice</li>
<li>Core Infrastructure and Transportation</li>
<li>Parks, Cultural, and Other Community Facilities</li>
<li>Administration of Government</li>
</ul>
<p>This data resource provides agencies and communities with easy access to data and neighborhood context needed for site planning, assessing service delivery, preparing neighborhood plans, or informing capital investment decisions. The facilities and program sites are generally operated, funded, licensed, or certified by a City, State, or Federal government agency. The facilities which are included are valuable for planning purposes because of the social services they provide and their role in land use typology which impacts activity in the neighborhood. For example parking lots and garages (including commerical garages) are captured in the database, both because they are an asset that residents and visitors use and because they could indicate increased vehicular traffic in the area.</p>
<p>Currently, FacDB aggregates and synthesizes data sourced from 42 agencies, recording more than 31,000 facilities throughout NYC. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the <a href="https://nycplanning.github.io/cpdocs/facilitiesdb/#overview">Overview</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, these records were updated only once per year in DCP's <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-selfac.page">Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database</a> which is now being retired. Beginning with this September 2016 release, the Facilities Database is rebranded and being produced using a revamped approach that relies heavily on automating the collection and transformation of data that agencies already publish. The process has been automated to pull from all available source datasets once per month, so that the database will capture and incorporate any changes in the source data. 85% of the data sources are open datasets that agencies publish independently.</p>
<p>We are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at <a href="mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov">Capital@planning.nyc.gov</a> with any suggestions.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-and-disclaimers">Limitations and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The FacDB is only as good as the source data it aggregates. Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Many records could not be geocoded. There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately these could not be systematically verified. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at <a href="mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov">Capital@planning.nyc.gov</a>.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="data-processing">Data Processing</h3>
<p>Since the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/scripts/tree/master/facilities-database/assembly">NYC Planning GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly.</strong>
First, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.</p>
<p><strong>Geoprocessing.</strong>
Many of the source datasets only provide addresses, no coordinates, and visa versa. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the <a href="https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api">GeoClient API</a> using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the coordinates and the BIN and BBL. Records with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN. There are also many cases where the coordinates provided by the agency fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the coordinates were left as provided, and the BBL was joined on according to which BBL edge was closest to the point coordinates. This closest BBL was used to fill in any other missing location information. Each record in the database is flagged in the with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicate Record Removal.</strong> Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BBL as a record with the same Facility Group. The contents of this subset is this examined for similarities in the Facility Name. The record with the most complete or most updated information was kept and other duplicate record is removed from the database.</p>
<p>The processing steps and assumptions used for each record are indicated in the Processing Flag (processingflag) field in the database. Each of the flags are defined in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="database-structure">Database structure</h2>
<p>Currently the database consists of two tables. One table contains all the geocoded records with spatial data, and one with the records which could not be geocoded.</p>
<p>In the future, some supplemental information which is specific to certain facility types will also be included in the database package as relational tables. For exmaple, a table of park attributes or a table with a more granular breakdown of school enrollment by grade could be joined onto the main table using a unique ID.</p>
