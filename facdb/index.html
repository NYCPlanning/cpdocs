<h2 id="i-overview">I. Overview</h2>
<p>The City Planning Facilities Database aggregates more than 35,000 records from 43 different public data sources provided by City, State, and Federal agencies. While each source agency classifies its facilities according to their own naming systems, we have grouped all facilities and program sites into the following seven categories to help planners navigate the data more easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and Human Services</li>
<li>Education, Child Welfare, and Youth</li>
<li>Parks, Gardens, and Historical Sites</li>
<li>Libraries and Cultural Programs</li>
<li>Public Safety, Emergency Services, and Administration of Justice</li>
<li>Core Infrastructure and Transportation</li>
<li>Administration of Government</li>
</ul>
<p>Within each of these domains, each record is further categorized into a set of facility groups, subgroups, and types that are intended to make the data easy to navigate and more useful for specific planning purposes. Facility types and names appear as they do in source datasets, wherever possible. A full listing of the facility categories is provided in the <a href="http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#ii-contents-and-classification-hierarchy">Contents and Classification Hierarchy</a> section.</p>
<p>This database and its <a href="http://capitalplanning.nyc.gov/facilities">interactive map</a> build upon City Planning’s decades-old work on the Selected Facilities and Program Sites Database, which this new product replaces. Improvements include more facility types, improved data quality, and a restructured database for easier use. We have also automated our means of refreshing the data from the majority of sources – we anticipate that the data will be refreshed on at least a quarterly basis (although source datasets may be refreshed less frequently). Please read more about the <a href="http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#iii-limitations-and-disclaimers">limitations</a> of this data product below.</p>
<p>More facilities will be added as the data become available to the Department of City Planning. Special thanks goes to all the agencies who make their data available for this effort, particularly those who publish their data on a routine basis.</p>
<p>We are constantly looking for ways to improve and add additional value to the database. Please reach out to the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at <a href="mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov with any suggestions">Capital@planning.nyc.gov</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ii-contents-and-classification-hierarchy">II. Contents and Classification Hierarchy</h2>
<p>In order of increasing granularity, each record that is included in the database is classified by DCP into a <strong>Domain &gt; Facility Group &gt; Facility Subgroup &gt; Facility Type</strong>. There are around 450 facility types. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description. The tables below describe each of the Subgroups in each of the seven Domains; however, the Facility Types within them are not listed.</p>

<h2 id="iii-limitations-and-disclaimers">III. Limitations and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB) is only as good as the source data it aggregates, and the Department of City Planning cannot verify the accuracy of all records. Please read more about specific data and analysis limitations before using this data.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis Limitations.</strong> As a result of these data limitations and inconsistencies listed below, users should be careful in their use of this database not to develop analyses that may be suspect. For example, a comparison of the density or accessibility of facilities across neighborhoods should recognize that some of the facilities included are organizational headquarters rather than service sites, and that this database is not authoritatively comprehensive. In addition, we rely on source data from other agencies to populate the database, and some of these sources may fall out-of-date. Users can find the date of each source dataset’s latest update in the <a href="http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#vi-source-data">Source Data</a> section.</p>
<p><strong>Missing Records.</strong> Currently, FacDB is the most comprehensive, spatial data resource available of facilities run by public and non-public entities in NYC, but it does not claim to capture every facility within the specified domains. Some facilities are deliberately excluded in the data that source agencies provide in order to protect the safety and privacy of their clients. Many records also could not be geocoded. To learn more about how the data is processed, please review the <a href="http://docs.capitalplanning.nyc/facdb/#iv-methodology">Methodology</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates.</strong> Please be aware that this beta version of the database includes cases of duplicate records for the same facility. This is because several of the source datasets have content that overlaps with other datasets. We are working to systematically identify these remaining duplicate records and retain all useful attributes from each record.</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Addresses.</strong> There are also known to be cases when the address provided in the source data is for a headquarters office rather the facility site location. Unfortunately, these could not be systematically verified. We hope to resolve as many of these limitations as possible over time, and seek feedback from the user community on potential approaches to improving the data. For more detailed information on a specific facility please reach out to the respective oversight agency.</p>
<p><strong>Public Accessibility of Sites.</strong> DCP is unable to verify the public accessibility of all sites. For example, some playgrounds or playing fields may only be accessible to participants in certain programs.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about or comments on these data please contact the NYC DCP Capital Planning team at <a href="mailto:Capital@planning.nyc.gov">Capital@planning.nyc.gov</a>.</p>
<h2 id="iv-methodology">IV. Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="data-processing">Data Processing</h3>
<p>Since the facility records are aggregated from many datasets designed for different purposes, the data has to undergo several stages of transformation to reach its final state. The stages are described below and all the scripts used are available on the <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/facilities-db">NYC Planning GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly.</strong>
First, the desired columns in the source data get mapped to the columns in FacDB schema. Many values also need to be recoded and the facility records then need to be classified. The facilities are classified using categories or descriptions provided by the agency. In general, the final Facility Type categories in FacDB are formatted versions of the original, most granular classification provided by the agency, but there are also cases where the source description was too specific and records were grouped together into broader type categories using keywords in the description.</p>
<p><strong>Geoprocessing.</strong>
Many of the source datasets only provide addresses without no coordinates. Records without coordinates are geocoded with the <a href="https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api">GeoClient API</a> using the Address and either the Borough or ZIP Code to get the BIN, BBL, and other standardized location details. If the record can be assigned a BIN value, the BIN's centroid is used as the point geometry. Records that are provided in the source data with only coordinates and no addresses are processed by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO to get the BBL and other location related details like Address, Borough, ZIP Code, and BIN when there is a 1-1 BIN-BBL relationship. There are also many cases where an agency provides coordinates but the coordinates they provided fall in the road bed, rather than inside a BBL boundary, due to the geocoding technique used by the source. In these cases, the geometry was replaced with the BBL centroid, if a BIN could not be assigned and used for the geometry instead. Each record in the database is flagged with a code for the geoprocessing technique that was used to complete all of its information.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicate Record Removal.</strong> Several of the source datasets have content which overlaps with other datasets. Duplicate records were identified by querying for all the records which fall on the same BIN or BBL as a record with the same Facility Subgroup or Type, same Facility Name, or same Oversight Agency. The values from the duplicate records were merged before dropping the duplicate records from the database.</p>
<!-- The processing steps and assumptions used for each record are indicated in the Processing Flag (processingflag) field in the database. Each of the flags are defined in the table below.

| Data Processing Flag | Definition |
| :-- | :-- |
| address2geom_borough | Geometry, BBL, BIN, and Zip Code were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and county or borough provided by agency. |
| address2geom_zipcode | Geometry, BBL, BIN, and borough were generated by NYC GeoClient using address and zip code provided by agency. |
| bbljoin | Geometry and address were provided by agency but without a BBL. BBL was obtained by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO |
| bbljoin2address | Geometry was provided by agency but without an address or BBL. BBL and address were obtained by doing a spatial join with MapPLUTO |
| bbljoin_closest | Geometry was provided by agency without a BBL. No spatial overlap was found with a BBL in MapPLUTO, even though the facility is of a type which should be located on a BBL lot. The closest BBL was assigned to the record. |
| bbljoin2address_closest | Geometry was provided by agency without an address or BBL. No spatial overlap was found with a BBL in MapPLUTO, even though the facility is of a type which should be located on a BBL lot. The closest BBL was assigned to the record. |
